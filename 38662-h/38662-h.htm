3</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a substantial biography of
George Borrow in two large volumes by the late Dr. Knapp, an
American professor who gave many years of devotion to the
subject.&nbsp; But I have had the singular advantage over Dr.
Knapp in that all the private letters and personal papers left by
Borrow to his step-daughter and heir, Henrietta MacOubrey, have
come into my hands.&nbsp; These include Borrow&rsquo;s letters to
his wife and step-daughter, many of which will be found scattered
through this biography.&nbsp; This book was first published under
the title of <i>George Borrow and his Circle</i>, but I am
grateful to a publisher for sending it forth once more in a form
which makes it available to a larger public.&nbsp; Certain new
letters from Borrow to his wife which have been found since the
first appearance of this book have been added, together with
other hitherto unprinted documents, making this issue of <i>The
Life of George Borrow</i> of much more value than its
predecessor.</p>

<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="smcap">Captain Borrow of the West Norfolk
Militia</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">George Henry Borrow</span> was born at
Dumpling Green near East Dereham, Norfolk, on the 5th of July,
1803.&nbsp; It pleased him to state on many an occasion that he
was born at East Dereham.</p>
<blockquote><p>On an evening of July, in the year 18&mdash;, at
East D&mdash;, a beautiful little town in a certain district of
East Anglia, I first saw the light,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he writes in the opening lines of <i>Lavengro</i>, using
almost the identical phraseology that we find in the opening
lines of Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>.&nbsp; Here
is a later memory of Dereham from <i>Lavengro</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What it is at present I know not, for thirty years
and more have elapsed since I last trod its streets.&nbsp; It
will scarcely have improved, for how could it be better than it
was?&nbsp; I love to think on thee, pretty, quiet D&mdash;, thou
pattern of an English country town, with thy clean but narrow
streets branching out from thy modest market-place, with their
old-fashioned houses, with here and there a roof of venerable
thatch, with thy one half-aristocratic mansion, where resided the
Lady Bountiful&mdash;she, the generous and kind, who loved to
visit the sick, leaning on her golden-headed cane, while the
sleek old footman walked at a respectful distance behind.&nbsp;
Pretty, quiet D&mdash;, with thy venerable church, in which
moulder the mortal remains of England&rsquo;s sweetest and most
pious bard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows an exquisite eulogy of the poet Cowper, which
readers of <i>Lavengro</i> know full well.&nbsp; Three years
before <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Borrow was born William Cowper died in this very town,
leaving behind him so rich a legacy of poetry and of prose, and
moreover so fragrant a memory of a life in which humour and
pathos played an equal part.&nbsp; It was no small thing for a
youth who aspired to any kind of renown to be born in the
neighbourhood of the last resting-place of the author of <i>The
Task</i>.</p>
<p>Yet Borrow was not actually born at East Dereham, but a mile
and a half away, at the little hamlet of Dumpling Green, in what
was then a glorious wilderness of common and furze bush, but is
now a quiet landscape of fields and hedges.&nbsp; You will find
the home in which the author of <i>Lavengro</i> first saw the
light without much difficulty.&nbsp; It is a fair-sized
farmhouse, with a long low frontage separated from the road by a
considerable strip of garden.&nbsp; It suggests a prosperous
yeoman class, and I have known farm-houses in East Anglia not one
whit larger dignified by the name of &ldquo;hall.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nearly opposite is a pond.&nbsp; The trim hedges are a delight to
us to-day, but you must cast your mind back to a century ago when
they were entirely absent.&nbsp; The house belonged to George
Borrow&rsquo;s maternal grandfather, Samuel Perfrement, who
farmed the adjacent land at this time.&nbsp; Samuel and Mary
Perfrement had eight children, the third of whom, Ann, was born
in 1772.</p>
<p>In February, 1793, Ann Perfrement, aged twenty-one, married
Thomas Borrow, aged thirty-five, in the Parish Church of East
Dereham, and of the two children that were born to them George
Henry Borrow was the younger.&nbsp; Thomas Borrow was the son of
one John Borrow of St. Cleer in Cornwall, who died before this
child was born, and is described by his grandson as the scion
&ldquo;of an ancient but reduced Cornish family, tracing descent
from the de Burghs, and entitled to carry their arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Thomas Borrow was born the family were nothing more than
small farmers, and Thomas Borrow and his brothers were working on
the land in the intervals of attending the parish school.&nbsp;
At the age of eighteen Thomas was apprenticed to a maltster at
Liskeard, and about this time he joined the local Militia.&nbsp;
Tradition has it that his career as a maltster was cut short by
his knocking his master down in a scrimmage.&nbsp; The victor
fled from the scene of his prowess, and enlisted as a private
soldier in the Coldstream Guards.&nbsp; <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>This was in 1783, and in 1792 he was
transferred to the West Norfolk Militia; hence his appearance at
East Dereham, where, now a serjeant, his occupations for many a
year were recruiting and drilling.&nbsp; It is recorded that at a
theatrical performance at East Dereham he first saw, presumably
on the stage of the county-hall, his future wife&mdash;Ann
Perfrement.&nbsp; She was, it seems, engaged in a minor part in a
travelling company, not, we may assume, altogether with the
sanction of her father, who, in spite of his inheritance of
French blood, doubtless shared the then very strong English
prejudice against the stage.&nbsp; However, Ann was one of eight
children, and had, as we shall find in after years, no
inconsiderable strength of character, and so may well at twenty
years of age have decided upon a career for herself.&nbsp; In any
case we need not press too hard the Cornish and French origin of
George Borrow to explain his wandering tendencies, nor need we
wonder at the suggestion of Nathaniel Hawthorne, that he was
&ldquo;supposed to be of gypsy descent by the mother&rsquo;s
side.&rdquo;&nbsp; You have only to think of the father, whose
work carried him from time to time to every corner of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, and of the mother with her reminiscence of
life in a travelling theatrical company, to explain in no small
measure the glorious vagabondage of George Borrow.</p>
<p>Behold then Thomas Borrow and Ann Perfrement as man and wife,
he being thirty-five years of age, she twenty-one.&nbsp; A
roving, restless life was in front of the pair for many a day,
the West Norfolk Militia being stationed in some eight or nine
separate towns within the interval of ten years between Thomas
Borrow&rsquo;s marriage and his second son&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp;
The first child, John Thomas Borrow, was born on the 15th April,
1801.&nbsp; The second son, George Henry Borrow, the subject of
this memoir, was born in his grandfather&rsquo;s house at
Dumpling Green, East Dereham, his mother having found a natural
refuge with her father while her husband was busily recruiting in
Norfolk.&nbsp; The two children passed with their parents from
place to place, and in 1809 we find them once again in East
Dereham.&nbsp; From his son&rsquo;s two books, <i>Lavengro</i>
and <i>Wild Wales</i>, we can trace the father&rsquo;s later
wanderings until his final retirement to Norwich on a
pension.&nbsp; In 1810 the family were at Norman Cross in
Huntingdonshire, when Captain Borrow had to assist in <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>guarding the
French prisoners of war; for it was the stirring epoch of the
Napoleonic conflict, and within the temporary prison &ldquo;six
thousand French and other foreigners, followers of the Grand
Corsican, were now immured.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>What a strange appearance had those mighty
casernes, with their blank blind walls, without windows, or
grating, and their slanting roofs, out of which, through orifices
where the tiles had been removed, would be protruded dozens of
grim heads, feasting their prison-sick eyes on the wide expanse
of country unfolded from that airy height.&nbsp; Ah! there was
much misery in those casernes; and from those roofs, doubtless,
many a wistful look was turned in the direction of lovely
France.&nbsp; Much had the poor inmates to endure, and much to
complain of, to the disgrace of England be it said&mdash;of
England, in general so kind and bountiful.&nbsp; Rations of
carrion meat, and bread from which I have seen the very hounds
occasionally turn away, were unworthy entertainment even for the
most ruffian enemy, when helpless and a captive; and such, alas!
was the fare in those casernes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here we have only to do with Thomas Borrow, of whom we get
many a quaint glimpse in <i>Lavengro</i>, our first and our last
being concerned with him in the one quality that his son seems to
have inherited, as the associate of a prize-fighter&mdash;Big Ben
Brain.&nbsp; Borrow records in his opening chapter that Ben Brain
and his father met in Hyde Park probably in 1790, and that after
an hour&rsquo;s conflict &ldquo;the champions shook hands and
retired, each having experienced quite enough of the
other&rsquo;s prowess.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow further relates that
four months afterwards Brain &ldquo;died in the arms of my
father, who read to him the Bible in his last
moments.&rdquo;&nbsp; More than once in his after years the old
soldier seems to have had a shy pride in that early conflict,
although the piety which seems to have come to him with the
responsibilities of wife and children led him to count any
recalling of the episode as a &ldquo;temptation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When Borrow was about thirteen years of age, he overheard his
father and mother discussing their two boys, the elder being the
father&rsquo;s favourite and George the mother&rsquo;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will hear nothing against my
first-born,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;even in the way of
insinuation: he is my joy and pride; the very image of myself in
my youthful days, long before I fought Big Ben, though perhaps
not quite so tall or strong built.&nbsp; As for the other, God
bless the child!&nbsp; I love him, I&rsquo;m sure; but I must be
blind not to see the difference between him and his
brother.&nbsp; Why, he has neither my hair nor my eyes; and then
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>his
countenance! why, &rsquo;tis absolutely swarthy, God forgive me!
I had almost said like that of a gypsy, but I have nothing to say
against that; the boy is not to be blamed for the colour of his
face, nor for his hair and eyes; but, then, his ways and
manners!&mdash;I confess I do not like them, and that they give
me no little uneasiness.&rdquo; <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow throughout his narrative refers to his father as
&ldquo;a man of excellent common sense,&rdquo; and he quotes the
opinion of William Taylor, who had rather a bad reputation as a
&ldquo;freethinker&rdquo; with all the church-going citizens of
Norwich, with no little pride.&nbsp; Borrow is of course the
&ldquo;young man&rdquo; of the dialogue.&nbsp; He was then
eighteen years of age:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not so, not so,&rdquo; said the young man
eagerly; &ldquo;before I knew you I knew nothing, and am still
very ignorant; but of late my father&rsquo;s health has been very
much broken, and he requires attention; his spirits also have
become low, which, to tell you the truth, he attributes to my
misconduct.&nbsp; He says that I have imbibed all kinds of
strange notions and doctrines, which will, in all probability,
prove my ruin, both here and hereafter;
which&mdash;which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I understand,&rdquo; said the elder, with
another calm whiff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have always had a kind of
respect for your father, for there is something remarkable in his
appearance, something heroic, and I would fain have cultivated
his acquaintance; the feeling, however, has not been
reciprocated.&nbsp; I met him the other day, up the road, with
his cane and dog, and saluted him; he did not return my
salutation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has certain opinions of his own,&rdquo; said the
youth, &ldquo;which are widely different from those which he has
heard that you profess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I respect a man for entertaining an opinion of his
own,&rdquo; said the elderly individual.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hold
certain opinions; but I should not respect an individual the more
for adopting them.&nbsp; All I wish for is tolerance, which I
myself endeavour to practise.&nbsp; I have always loved the
truth, and sought it; if I have not found it, the greater my
misfortune.&rdquo; <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Borrow is twenty years of age we have another glimpse of
father and son, the father in his last illness, the son eager as
usual to draw out his parent upon the one subject that appeals to
his adventurous spirit, &ldquo;I should like to know something
about Big Ben,&rdquo; he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You are a strange lad,&rdquo; said my
father; &ldquo;and though of late I have begun to entertain a
more favourable opinion than heretofore, there is still much
about you that I do not understand.&nbsp; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Why do you
bring up that name?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that it is one of
my temptations?&nbsp; You wish to know something about him?&nbsp;
Well, I will oblige you this once, and then farewell to such
vanities&mdash;something about him.&nbsp; I will tell
you&mdash;his&mdash;skin when he flung off his clothes&mdash;and
he had a particular knack in doing so&mdash;his skin, when he
bared his mighty chest and back for combat; and when he fought he
stood, so if I remember right&mdash;his skin, I say, was brown
and dusky as that of a toad.&nbsp; Oh me!&nbsp; I wish my elder
son was here!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning the career of Borrow&rsquo;s father there seem to
be no documents other than one contained in <i>Lavengro</i>, yet
no <i>Life of Borrow</i> can possibly be complete that does not
draw boldly upon the son&rsquo;s priceless tributes.&nbsp; And so
we come now to the last scene in the career of the elder
Borrow&mdash;his death-bed&mdash;which is also the last page of
the first volume of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; George Borrow&rsquo;s
brother has arrived from abroad.&nbsp; The little house in Willow
Lane, Norwich, contained the mother and her two sons sorrowfully
awaiting the end, which came on 28th February, 1824.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the dead hour of night&mdash;it might be about
two&mdash;I was awakened from sleep by a cry which sounded from
the room immediately below that in which I slept.&nbsp; I knew
the cry&mdash;it was the cry of my mother; and I also knew its
import, yet I made no effort to rise, for I was for the moment
paralysed.&nbsp; Again the cry sounded, yet still I lay
motionless&mdash;the stupidity of horror was upon me.&nbsp; A
third time, and it was then that, by a violent effort, bursting
the spell which appeared to bind me, I sprang from the bed and
rushed downstairs.&nbsp; My mother was running wildly about the
room; she had awoke and found my father senseless in the bed by
her side.&nbsp; I essayed to raise him, and after a few efforts
supported him in the bed in a sitting posture.&nbsp; My brother
now rushed in, and, snatching up a light that was burning, he
held it to my father&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;The surgeon! the
surgeon!&rdquo; he cried; then, dropping the light, he ran out of
the room, followed by my mother; I remained alone, supporting the
senseless form of my father; the light had been extinguished by
the fall, and an almost total darkness reigned in the room.&nbsp;
The form pressed heavily against my bosom; at last methought it
moved.&nbsp; Yes, I was right; there was a heaving of the breast,
and then a gasping.&nbsp; Were those words which I heard?&nbsp;
Yes, they were words, low and indistinct at first, and then
audible.&nbsp; The mind of the dying man was reverting to former
scenes.&nbsp; I heard him mention names which I had often heard
him mention before.&nbsp; It was an awful moment; I felt
stupefied, but I still contrived to support my dying
father.&nbsp; There was a pause; again my father spoke: I heard
him speak of Minden, and of Meredith, the old Minden Serjeant,
and then he uttered another name, which at one period <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>of his life
was much on his lips, the name of &mdash;; but this is a solemn
moment!&nbsp; There was a deep gasp: I shook, and thought all was
over; but I was mistaken&mdash;my father moved, and revived for a
moment; he supported himself in bed without my assistance.&nbsp;
I make no doubt that for a moment he was perfectly sensible, and
it was then that, clasping his hands, he uttered another name
clearly, distinctly&mdash;it was the name of Christ.&nbsp; With
that name upon his lips the brave old soldier sank back upon my
bosom, and, with his hands still clasped, yielded up his
soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did Borrow&rsquo;s father ever really fight Big Ben Brain or
Bryan in Hyde Park, or is it all a fantasy of the artist&rsquo;s
imagining?&nbsp; We shall never know.&nbsp; Borrow called his
<i>Lavengro</i> &ldquo;An Autobiography&rdquo; at one stage of
its inception, although he wished to repudiate the
autobiographical nature of his story at another.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp
in his anxiety to prove that Borrow wrote his own memoirs in
<i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Romany Rye</i> tells us that he had no
creative faculty&mdash;an absurd proposition.&nbsp; But I think
we may accept the contest between Ben Brain and Thomas Borrow,
and what a revelation of heredity that impressive death-bed scene
may be counted.&nbsp; Borrow on one occasion in later life
declared that his favourite books were the Bible and the Newgate
Calendar.&nbsp; We know that he specialised on the Bible and
Prize-Fighting in no ordinary fashion&mdash;and here we see his
father on his death-bed struggling between the religious
sentiments of his maturity and the one great worldly escapade of
his early manhood.</p>
<h2><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smcap">Borrow&rsquo;s Mother</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Throughout</span> his whole life George
Borrow adored his mother, who seems to have developed into a
woman of great strength of character far remote from the pretty
play-actor who won the heart of a young soldier at East Dereham
in the last years of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; We would
gladly know something of the early years of Ann Perfrement.&nbsp;
Her father was a farmer, whose farm at Dumpling Green we have
already described.&nbsp; He did not, however, &ldquo;farm his own
little estate&rdquo; as Borrow declared.&nbsp; The
grandfather&mdash;a French Protestant&mdash;came, if we are to
believe Borrow, from Caen in Normandy after the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes, but there is no documentary evidence to support
the contention.&nbsp; However, the story of the Huguenot
immigration into England is clearly bound up with Norwich and the
adjacent district.&nbsp; And so we may well take the name of
&ldquo;Perfrement&rdquo; as conclusive evidence of a French
origin, and reject as utterly untenable the not unnatural
suggestion of Nathaniel Hawthorne, that Borrow&rsquo;s mother was
&ldquo;of gypsy descent.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was one of the eight
children of Samuel and Mary Perfrement, all of whom seem to have
devoted their lives to East Anglia.&nbsp; We owe to Dr.
Knapp&rsquo;s edition of <i>Lavengro</i> one exquisite glimpse of
Ann&rsquo;s girlhood that is not in any other issue of the
book.&nbsp; Ann&rsquo;s elder sister, curious to know if she was
ever to be married, falls in with the current superstition that
she must wash her linen and &ldquo;watch&rdquo; it drying before
the fire between eleven and twelve at night.&nbsp; Ann Perfrement
was ten years old at the time.&nbsp; The two girls walked over to
East Dereham, purchased the necessary garment, washed it in the
pool near the house that may still be seen, and watched and
watched.&nbsp; Suddenly when the clock struck twelve they heard,
or thought they heard, a footstep on the path, the wind howled,
and the elder sister sprang to the door, locked and bolted it,
and then fell in convulsions on the floor.&nbsp; The
superstition, which Borrow <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>seems to have told his mother had a
Danish origin, is common enough in Ireland and in Celtic
lands.&nbsp; It could scarcely have been thus rehearsed by two
Norfolk children had they not had the blood of a more imaginative
race in their veins.&nbsp; In addition to this we find more than
one effective glimpse of Borrow&rsquo;s mother in
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; We have already noted the episode in which
she takes the side of her younger boy against her husband, with
whom John was the favourite.&nbsp; We meet her again when after
his father&rsquo;s death George had shouldered his knapsack and
made his way to London to seek his fortune by literature.&nbsp;
His elder brother had remained at home, determined upon being a
painter, but joined George in London, leaving the widowed mother
momentarily alone in Norwich.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And how are things going on at home?&rdquo;
said I to my brother, after we had kissed and embraced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How is my mother, and how is the dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, thank God, is tolerably well,&rdquo; said my
brother, &ldquo;but very much given to fits of crying.&nbsp; As
for the dog, he is not so well; but we will talk more of these
matters anon,&rdquo; said my brother, again glancing at the
breakfast things.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am very hungry, as you may
suppose, after having travelled all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I exerted myself to the best of my ability to
perform the duties of hospitality, and I made my brother
welcome&mdash;I may say more than welcome; and when the rage of
my brother&rsquo;s hunger was somewhat abated, we recommenced
talking about the matters of our little family, and my brother
told me much about my mother; he spoke of her fits of crying, but
said that of late the said fits of crying had much diminished,
and she appeared to be taking comfort; and, if I am not much
mistaken, my brother told me that my mother had of late the
prayer-book frequently in her hand, and yet oftener the Bible. <a

</blockquote>
<p>Ann Borrow lived in Willow Lane, Norwich, for thirty-three
years.&nbsp; That Borrow was a devoted husband these pages will
show.&nbsp; He was also a devoted son.&nbsp; When he had made a
prosperous marriage he tried hard to persuade his mother to live
with him at Oulton, but all in vain.&nbsp; She had the wisdom to
see that such an arrangement is rarely conducive to a son&rsquo;s
domestic happiness.&nbsp; She continued to live in the little
cottage made sacred by many associations until almost the end of
her days.&nbsp; Here she had lived in earlier years with her
husband and her two ambitious boys, and in Norwich, doubtless,
she had made her own friendships, <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>although of these no record
remains.&nbsp; The cottage still stands in its modest court, and
now serves the worthy purpose of a museum for Borrow
relics.&nbsp; In Borrow&rsquo;s day it was the property of Thomas
King, a carpenter.&nbsp; You enter from Willow Lane through a
covered passage into what was then known as King&rsquo;s
Court.&nbsp; Here the little house faces you, and you meet it
with a peculiarly agreeable sensation, recalling more than one
incident in <i>Lavengro</i> that transpired there.&nbsp; Thomas
King, the carpenter, was in direct descent in the maternal line
from the family of Parker, which gave to Norwich one of its most
distinguished sons in the famous Archbishop of Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; He extended his business as
carpenter sufficiently to die a prosperous builder.&nbsp; Of his
two sons one, also named Thomas, became physician to Prince
Talleyrand, and married a sister of John Stuart Mill.&nbsp; All
this by the way, but there is little more to record of
Borrow&rsquo;s mother apart from the letters addressed to her by
her son, which occur in their due place in these records.&nbsp;
Yet one little memorandum among my papers which bears Mrs.
Borrow&rsquo;s signature may well find place here:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the year 1797 I was at Canterbury.&nbsp; One
night at about one o&rsquo;clock Sir Robert Laurie and Captain
Treve came to our lodgings and tapped at our bedroom door, and
told my husband to get up, and get the men under arms without
beat of drum as soon as possible, for that there was a mutiny at
the Nore.&nbsp; My husband did so, and in less than two hours
they had marched out of town towards Sheerness without making any
noise.&nbsp; They had to break open the store-house in order to
get provender, because the Quartermaster, Serjeant Rowe, was out
of the way.&nbsp; The Dragoon Guards at that time at Canterbury
were in a state of mutiny.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ann
Borrow</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smcap">John Thomas Borrow</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">John Thomas Borrow</span> was born two
years before his younger brother, that is, on the 15th of April,
1801.&nbsp; His father, then Serjeant Borrow, was wandering from
town to town, and it is not known where his elder son first saw
the light.&nbsp; John Borrow&rsquo;s nature was cast in a
somewhat different mould from that of his brother.&nbsp; He was
his father&rsquo;s pride.&nbsp; Serjeant Borrow could not
understand George with his extraordinary taste for the society of
queer people&mdash;the wild Irish and the ragged Romanies.&nbsp;
John had far more of the normal in his being.&nbsp; Borrow gives
us in <i>Lavengro</i> our earliest glimpse of his brother:</p>
<blockquote><p>He was a beautiful child; one of those
occasionally seen in England, and in England alone; a rosy,
angelic face, blue eyes, and light chestnut hair; it was not
exactly an Anglo-Saxon countenance, in which, by the by, there is
generally a cast of loutishness and stupidity; it partook, to a
certain extent, of the Celtic character, particularly in the fire
and vivacity which illumined it; his face was the mirror of his
mind; perhaps no disposition more amiable was ever found amongst
the children of Adam, united, however, with no inconsiderable
portion of high and dauntless spirit.&nbsp; So great was his
beauty in infancy, that people, especially those of the poorer
classes, would follow the nurse who carried him about in order to
look at and bless his lovely face.&nbsp; At the age of three
months an attempt was made to snatch him from his mother&rsquo;s
arms in the streets of London, at the moment she was about to
enter a coach; indeed, his appearance seemed to operate so
powerfully upon every person who beheld him, that my parents were
under continual apprehension of losing him; his beauty, however,
was perhaps surpassed by the quickness of his parts.&nbsp; He
mastered his letters in a few hours, and in a day or two could
decipher the names of people on the doors of houses and over the
shop-windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John received his early education at the Norwich Grammar
School, while the younger brother was kept under the paternal
wing.&nbsp; Father and mother, with their younger boy George,
were always on the move, passing from county to county and from
country to country, as Serjeant Borrow, <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>soon to be
Captain, attended to his duties of drilling and recruiting, now
in England, now in Scotland, now in Ireland.&nbsp; We are given a
fascinating glimpse of John Borrow in <i>Lavengro</i> by way of a
conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Borrow over the education of
their children.&nbsp; It was agreed that while the family were in
Edinburgh the boys should be sent to the High School, and so at
the historic school that Sir Walter Scott had attended a
generation before the two boys were placed, John being removed
from the Norwich Grammar School for the purpose.&nbsp; Among his
many prejudices of after years Borrow&rsquo;s dislike of Scott
was perhaps the most regrettable, otherwise he would have gloried
in the fact that their childhood had had one remarkable point in
common.&nbsp; Each boy took part in the feuds between the Old
Town and the New Town.&nbsp; Exactly as Scott records his prowess
at &ldquo;the manning of the Cowgate Port,&rdquo; and the combats
maintained with great vigour, &ldquo;with stones, and sticks, and
fisticuffs,&rdquo; as set forth in the first volume of Lockhart,
so we have not dissimilar feats set down in
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; Side by side also with the story of
&ldquo;Green-Breeks,&rdquo; which stands out in Scott&rsquo;s
narrative of his school combats, we have the more lurid account
by Borrow of David Haggart.&nbsp; Literary biography is made more
interesting by such episodes of likeness and of contrast.</p>
<p>We next find John Borrow in Ireland with his father, mother,
and brother.&nbsp; George is still a child, but he is precocious
enough to be learning the language, and thus laying the
foundation of his interest in little-known tongues.&nbsp; John is
now an ensign in his father&rsquo;s regiment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! he
was a sweet being, that boy soldier, a plant of early promise,
bidding fair to become in after time all that is great, good, and
admirable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ensign John tells his little brother how
pleased he is to find himself, although not yet sixteen years
old, &ldquo;a person in authority with many Englishmen under
me.&nbsp; Oh! these last six weeks have passed like hours in
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was in 1816, and we do not meet John
again until five years later, when we hear of him rushing into
the water to save a drowning man, while twenty others were
bathing who might have rendered assistance.&nbsp; Borrow records
once again his father&rsquo;s satisfaction:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My boy, my own boy, you are the very image
of myself, the day I took off my coat in the park to fight Big
Ben,&rdquo; said my <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>father, on meeting his son, wet and dripping,
immediately after his bold feat.&nbsp; And who cannot excuse the
honest pride of the old man&mdash;the stout old man?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the interval the war had ended, and Napoleon had departed
for St. Helena.&nbsp; Peace had led to the pensioning of militia
officers, or reducing to half-pay of the juniors.&nbsp; The elder
Borrow had settled in Norwich.&nbsp; George was set to study at
the Grammar School there, while his brother worked in Old
Crome&rsquo;s studio, for here was a moment when Norwich had its
interesting Renaissance, and John Borrow was bent on being an
artist.&nbsp; He had worked with Crome once before&mdash;during
the brief interval that Napoleon was at Elba&mdash;but now he set
to in real earnest, and we have evidence of a score of pictures
by him that were catalogued in the exhibitions of the Norwich
Society of Artists between the years 1817 and 1824.&nbsp; They
include one portrait of the artist&rsquo;s father, and two of his
brother George.&nbsp; Old Crome died in 1821, and then John went
to London to study under Haydon.&nbsp; Borrow declares that his
brother had real taste for painting, and that &ldquo;if
circumstances had not eventually diverted his mind from the
pursuit, he would have attained excellence, and left behind him
some enduring monument of his powers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He
lacked, however,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;one thing, the want
of which is but too often fatal to the sons of genius, and
without which genius is little more than a splendid toy in the
hands of the possessor&mdash;perseverance, dogged
perseverance.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is when he is thus commenting on
his brother&rsquo;s characteristics that Borrow gives his own
fine if narrow eulogy of Old Crome.&nbsp; John Borrow seems to
have continued his studies in London under Haydon for a year, and
then to have gone to Paris to copy pictures at the Louvre.&nbsp;
He mentions a particular copy that he made of a celebrated
picture by one of the Italian masters, for which a Hungarian
nobleman paid him well.&nbsp; His three years&rsquo; absence was
brought to an abrupt termination by news of his father&rsquo;s
illness.&nbsp; He returned to Norwich in time to stand by that
father&rsquo;s bedside when he died.&nbsp; The elder Borrow died,
as we have seen, in February, 1824.&nbsp; The little home in
King&rsquo;s Court was kept on for the mother, and as John was
making money by his pictures it was understood that he should
stay with her.&nbsp; On the 1st April, however, George <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>started for
London, carrying the manuscript of <i>Romantic Ballads from the
Danish</i> to Sir Richard Phillips, the publisher.&nbsp; On the
29th of the same month he was joined by his brother John.&nbsp;
John had come to London at his own expense, but in the interests
of the Norwich Town Council.&nbsp; The council wanted a portrait
of one of its mayors for St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall&mdash;that
Valhalla of Norwich municipal worthies which still strikes the
stranger as well-nigh unique in the city life of England.&nbsp;
The municipality would fain have encouraged a fellow-citizen, and
John Borrow had been invited to paint the portrait.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; it was asked, &ldquo;should the money go into
a stranger&rsquo;s pocket and be spent in London?&rdquo;&nbsp;
John, however, felt diffident of his ability and declined, and
this in spite of the fact that the &pound;100 offered for the
portrait must have been very tempting.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pity
it was,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Crome was dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Crome,&rdquo; said the orator of the deputation that had
called on John Borrow,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Crome; yes, he was a clever man, a very
clever man, in his way; he was good at painting landscapes and
farm-houses, but he would not do in the present instance, were he
alive.&nbsp; He had no conception of the heroic, sir.&nbsp; We
want some person capable of representing our mayor standing under
the Norman arch of the cathedral.&rdquo; <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the mention of the heroic John bethought himself of Haydon,
and suggested his name; hence his visit to London, and his
proposed interview with Haydon.&nbsp; The two brothers went
together to call upon the &ldquo;painter of the heroic&rdquo; at
his studio in Connaught Terrace, Hyde Park.&nbsp; There was some
difficulty about their admission, and it turned out afterwards
that Haydon thought they might be duns, as he was very hard up at
the time.&nbsp; His eyes glistened at the mention of the
&pound;100.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not very fond of painting
portraits,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but a mayor is a mayor, and
there is something grand in that idea of the Norman
arch.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus Mayor Hawkes came to be painted by
Benjamin Haydon, and his portrait may be found, not without
diligent search, among the many municipal worthies that figure on
the walls of that most picturesque old Hall in Norwich.&nbsp;
Here is Borrow&rsquo;s description of the painting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The original mayor was a mighty, portly man, with
a bull&rsquo;s head, black hair, body like that of a dray horse,
and legs and <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>thighs corresponding; a man six foot high at the
least.&nbsp; To his bull&rsquo;s head, black hair, and body the
painter had done justice; there was one point, however, in which
the portrait did not correspond with the original&mdash;the legs
were disproportionably short, the painter having substituted his
own legs for those of the mayor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Borrow described Robert Hawkes to his brother as a person
of many qualifications:</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;big and portly, with a voice like
Boanerges; a religious man, the possessor of an immense pew;
loyal, so much so that I once heard him say that he would at any
time go three miles to hear any one sing <i>God save the
King</i>; moreover, a giver of excellent dinners.&nbsp; Such is
our present mayor, who, owing to his loyalty, his religion, and a
little, perhaps, to his dinners, is a mighty favourite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haydon, who makes no mention of the Borrows in his
<i>Correspondence</i> or <i>Autobiography</i>, although there is
one letter of George Borrow&rsquo;s to him in the former work,
had been in jail for debt three years prior to the visit of the
Borrows.&nbsp; He was then at work on his greatest success in
&ldquo;the heroic&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Raising of Lazarus</i>, a
canvas nineteen feet long by fifteen high.&nbsp; The debt was one
to house decorators, for the artist had ever large ideas.&nbsp;
The bailiff, he tells us, <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a> was so agitated at
the sight of the painting of Lazarus in the studio that he cried
out, &ldquo;Oh, my God!&nbsp; Sir, I won&rsquo;t arrest
you.&nbsp; Give me your word to meet me at twelve at the
attorney&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1821
Haydon married, and a little later we find him again
&ldquo;without a single shilling in the world&mdash;with a large
picture before me not half done.&rdquo;&nbsp; In April, 1822, he
is arrested at the instance of his colourman, &ldquo;with whom I
had dealt for fifteen years,&rdquo; and in November of the same
year he is arrested again at the instance of &ldquo;a miserable
apothecary.&rdquo;&nbsp; In April, 1823, we find him in the
King&rsquo;s Bench Prison, from which he was released in
July.&nbsp; <i>The Raising of Lazarus</i> meanwhile had gone to
pay his upholsterer &pound;300, and his <i>Christ&rsquo;s Entry
into Jerusalem</i> had been sold for &pound;240, although it had
brought him &pound;3000 in receipts at exhibitions.&nbsp; Clearly
heroic pictures did not pay, and Haydon here took up &ldquo;the
torment of portrait-painting&rdquo; as he called it.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Can you wonder,&rdquo; he wrote in July, 1825,
&ldquo;that I nauseate portraits, except portraits of clever
people.&nbsp; I feel quite convinced that every portrait-painter,
if there be purgatory, will leap at once to heaven, without this
previous purification.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it was Mayor Hawkes who helped to inspire this
feeling.&nbsp; Yet the hundred pounds that John Borrow was able
to procure must have been a godsend, for shortly before this we
find him writing in his diary of the desperation that caused him
to sell his books.&nbsp; &ldquo;Books that had cost me &pound;20
I got only &pound;3 for.&nbsp; But it was better than
starvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed it was in April of this year that
the very baker was &ldquo;insolent,&rdquo; and so in May, 1824,
as we learn from Tom Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>, he produced
&ldquo;a full-length portrait of Mr. Hawkes, a late Mayor of
Norwich, painted for St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall in that
city.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I must leave Haydon&rsquo;s troubled
career, which closes so far as the two brothers are concerned
with a letter from George to Haydon written the following year
from 26 Bryanston Street, Portman Square:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I
should feel extremely obliged if you would allow me to sit to you
as soon as possible.&nbsp; I am going to the south of France in
little better than a fortnight, and I would sooner lose a
thousand pounds than not have the honour of appearing in the
picture.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>. <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Borrow was at the time in a most impoverished condition, it
is not easy to believe that he would have wished to be taken at
his word.&nbsp; He certainly had not a thousand pounds to
lose.&nbsp; But he did undoubtedly, as we shall see, take that
journey on foot through the south of France, after the manner of
an earlier vagabond of literature&mdash;Oliver Goldsmith.&nbsp;
Haydon was to be far too much taken up with his own troubles
during the coming months to think any more about the Borrows when
he had once completed the portrait of the mayor, which he had
done by July of this year.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s letter to him is,
however, an obvious outcome of a remark dropped by the painter on
the occasion of his one visit to his studio when the following
conversation took place:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to the heroic,&rdquo; said
the painter; &ldquo;I now and then dabble in the comic, but what
I do gives me no pleasure, the <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>comic is so low; there is nothing
like the heroic.&nbsp; I am engaged here on a heroic
picture,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the canvas; &ldquo;the
subject is &lsquo;Pharaoh dismissing Moses from Egypt,&rsquo;
after the last plague&mdash;the death of the first-born,&mdash;it
is not far advanced&mdash;that finished figure is Moses&rdquo;:
they both looked at the canvas, and I, standing behind, took a
modest peep.&nbsp; The picture, as the painter said, was not far
advanced, the Pharaoh was merely in outline; my eye was, of
course, attracted by the finished figure, or rather what the
painter had called the finished figure; but, as I gazed upon it,
it appeared to me that there was something
defective&mdash;something unsatisfactory in the figure.&nbsp; I
concluded, however, that the painter, notwithstanding what he had
said, had omitted to give it the finishing touch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
intend this to be my best picture,&rdquo; said the painter;
&ldquo;what I want now is a face for Pharaoh; I have long been
meditating on a face for Pharaoh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, chancing to
cast his eye upon my countenance, of whom he had scarcely taken
any manner of notice, he remained with his mouth open for some
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; said he at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, this is my brother, I forgot to introduce
him&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We wish that the acquaintance had extended further, but this
was not to be.&nbsp; Borrow was soon to commence the wanderings
which were to give him much unsatisfactory fame, and the pair
never met again.&nbsp; Let us, however, return to John Borrow,
who accompanied Haydon to Norwich, leaving his brother for some
time longer to the tender mercies of Sir Richard Phillips.&nbsp;
John, we judge, seems to have had plenty of shrewdness, and was
not without a sense of his own limitations.&nbsp; A chance came
to him of commercial success in a distant land, and he seized
that chance.&nbsp; A Norwich friend, Allday Kerrison, had gone
out to Mexico, and writing from Zacatecas in 1825 asked John to
join him.&nbsp; John accepted.&nbsp; His salary in the service of
the Real del Monte Company was to be &pound;300 per annum.&nbsp;
He sailed for Mexico in 1826, having obtained from his Colonel,
Lord Orford, leave of absence for a year, it being understood
that renewals of that leave of absence might be granted.&nbsp; He
was entitled to half-pay as a Lieutenant of the West Norfolk
Militia, and this he settled upon his mother during his
absence.&nbsp; His career in Mexico was a failure.&nbsp; There
are many of his letters to his mother and brother extant which
tell of the difficulties of his situation.&nbsp; He was in three
Mexican companies in succession, and was about to be sent to
Columbia to take charge of a mine when he was stricken with a
fever, and died at Guanajuato on 22nd November, 1833.&nbsp; He
had far exceeded any leave that his Colonel could <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>in fairness
grant, and before his death his name had been taken off the army
rolls.</p>
<p>I have said that there are letters of John Borrow&rsquo;s
extant.&nbsp; These show a keen intelligence, great practicality,
and common sense.&nbsp; George&mdash;in 1829&mdash;had asked his
brother as to joining him in Mexico.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the country
is soon settled I shall say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;&rdquo; John
answers.&nbsp; With equal wisdom he says to his brother,
&ldquo;Do not enter the army; it is a bad spec.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
this same year, 1829, John writes to ask whether his mother and
brother are &ldquo;still living in that windy house of old
King&rsquo;s; it gives me the rheumatism to think of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1830 he writes to his mother that he wishes
his brother were making money.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither he nor I have
any luck, he works hard and remains poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
February of 1831 John writes to George suggesting that he should
endeavour to procure a commission in the regiment, and in July of
the same year to try the law again:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am convinced that your want of success in life
is more owing to your being unlike other people than to any other
cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John, as we have seen, died in Mexico of fever.&nbsp; George
was at St. Petersburg working for the Bible Society when his
mother writes from Norwich to tell him the news.&nbsp; John had
died on 22nd November, 1833.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are now my only
hope,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;. . . do not grieve, my dear
George.&nbsp; I trust we shall all meet in heaven.&nbsp; Put a
crape on your hat for some time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had George
Borrow&rsquo;s brother lived it might have meant very much in his
life.&nbsp; There might have been nephews and nieces to soften
the asperity of his later years.&nbsp; Who can say?&nbsp;
Meanwhile, <i>Lavengro</i> contains no happier pages than those
concerned with this dearly loved brother.</p>

25</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smcap">A Wandering Childhood</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> do not need to inquire too
deeply as to Borrow&rsquo;s possible gypsy origin in order to
account for his vagabond propensities.&nbsp; The lives of his
parents before his birth, and the story of his own boyhood,
sufficiently account for the dominant tendency in Borrow.&nbsp;
His father and mother were married in 1793.&nbsp; Almost every
year they changed their domicile.&nbsp; In 1801 a son was born to
them,&mdash;they still continued to change their domicile.&nbsp;
Captain Borrow followed his regiment from place to place, and his
family accompanied him on these journeys.&nbsp; Dover,
Colchester, Sandgate, Canterbury, Chelmsford&mdash;these are some
of the towns where the Borrows sojourned.&nbsp; It was the merest
accident&mdash;the Peace of Amiens, to be explicit&mdash;that led
them back to East Dereham in 1803, so that the second son was
born in his grandfather&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; George was only a
month old when he was carried off to Colchester; in 1804 he was
in the barracks of Kent, in 1805 of Sussex, in 1806 at Hastings,
in 1807 at Canterbury, and so on.&nbsp; The whole of the first
thirteen years of Borrow&rsquo;s life is filled up in this way,
until in 1816 he and his parents found a home of some permanence
in Norwich.&nbsp; In 1809&ndash;10 they were at East Dereham, in
1810&ndash;11 at Norman Cross, in 1812 wandering from Harwich to
Sheffield, and in 1813 wandering from Sheffield to Edinburgh; in
1814 they were in Norwich, and in 1815&ndash;16 in Ireland.&nbsp;
In this last year they returned to Norwich, the father to retire
on full pay, and to live in Willow Lane until his death.&nbsp;
How could a boy, whose first twelve years of life had been made
up of such continual wandering, have been other than a restless,
nomad-loving man, envious of the free life of the gypsies, for
whom alone in later life he seemed to have kindliness?&nbsp;
Those twelve years are to most boys merely the making of a moral
foundation for good or ill; to Borrow they were everything, and
at least four personalities captured his imagination during that
short span, as we see if we follow <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>his juvenile wanderings more in
detail to Dereham, Norman Cross, Edinburgh, and Clonmel, and the
personalities are Lady Fenn, Ambrose Smith, David Haggart, and
Murtagh.&nbsp; Let us deal with each in turn:</p>
<p>In our opening chapter we referred to the lines in
<i>Lavengro</i>, where Borrow recalls his early impressions of
his native town, or at least the town in the neighbourhood of the
hamlet in which he was born.&nbsp; Borrow, we may be sure, would
have repudiated &ldquo;Dumpling Green&rdquo; if he could.&nbsp;
The name had a humorous suggestion.&nbsp; To this day they call
boys from Norfolk &ldquo;Norfolk Dumplings&rdquo; in the
neighbouring shires.&nbsp; But East Dereham was something to be
proud of.&nbsp; In it had died the writer who, through the
greater part of Borrow&rsquo;s life, remained the favourite poet
of that half of England which professed the Evangelical creed in
which Borrow was brought up.&nbsp; Cowper was buried here by the
side of Mary Unwin, and every Sunday little George would see his
tomb just as Henry Kingsley was wont to see the tombs in Chelsea
Old Church.&nbsp; The fervour of devotion to Cowper&rsquo;s
memory that obtained in those early days must have been a
stimulus to the boy, who from the first had ambitions far beyond
anything that he was to achieve.&nbsp; Here was his first
lesson.&nbsp; The second came from Lady Fenn&mdash;a more vivid
impression for the child.&nbsp; Twenty years before Borrow was
born Cowper had sung her merits in his verse.&nbsp; She and her
golden-headed cane are commemorated in <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp;
Dame Eleanor Fenn had made a reputation in her time.&nbsp; As
&ldquo;Mrs. Teachwell&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mrs. Lovechild&rdquo; she
had published books for the young of a most improving character,
<i>The Child&rsquo;s Grammar</i>, <i>The Mother&rsquo;s
Grammar</i>, <i>A Short History of Insects</i>, and <i>Cobwebs to
Catch Flies</i> being of the number.&nbsp; The forty-fourth
edition of <i>The Child&rsquo;s Grammar</i> by Mrs. Lovechild
appeared in 1851, and the twenty-second edition of <i>The
Mother&rsquo;s Grammar</i> in 1849.&nbsp; But it is her husband
that her name most recalls to us.&nbsp; Sir John Fenn gave us the
delightful Paston Letters&mdash;of which Horace Walpole said that
&ldquo;they make all other letters not worth
reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; Walpole described &ldquo;Mr. Fenn of East
Dereham in Norfolk&rdquo; as &ldquo;a smatterer in antiquity, but
a very good sort of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fenn, who held the original
documents of the Letters, sent his first two volumes, when
published, to Buckingham Palace, and the King acknowledged <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the gifts by
knighting the editor, who, however, died in 1794, before George
Borrow was born.&nbsp; His widow survived until 1813, and Borrow
was in his seventh or eighth year when he caught these notable
glimpses of his &ldquo;Lady Bountiful,&rdquo; who lived in
&ldquo;the half-aristocratic mansion&rdquo; of the town.&nbsp;
But we know next to nothing of Borrow in East Dereham, from which
indeed he departed in his eighth year.&nbsp; There are, however,
interesting references to his memories of the place in
<i>Lavengro</i>, the best of which is when he goes to church with
the gypsies and dreams of an incident in his childhood:</p>
<blockquote><p>It appeared as if I had fallen asleep in the pew
of the old church of pretty Dereham.&nbsp; I had occasionally
done so when a child, and had suddenly woke up.&nbsp; Yes,
surely, I had been asleep and had woke up; but no! if I had been
asleep I had been waking in my sleep, struggling, striving,
learning and unlearning in my sleep.&nbsp; Years had rolled away
whilst I had been asleep&mdash;ripe fruit had fallen, green fruit
had come on whilst I had been asleep&mdash;how circumstances had
altered, and above all myself whilst I had been asleep.&nbsp; No,
I had not been asleep in the old church!&nbsp; I was in a pew, it
is true, but not the pew of black leather in which I sometimes
fell asleep in days of yore, but in a strange pew; and then my
companions, they were no longer those of days of yore.&nbsp; I
was no longer with my respectable father and mother, and my dear
brother, but with the gypsy cral and his wife, and the gigantic
Tawno, the Antinous of the dusky people.&nbsp; And what was I
myself?&nbsp; No longer an innocent child but a moody man,
bearing in my face, as I knew well, the marks of my strivings and
strugglings; of what I had learnt and unlearnt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Borrow left Dereham in his eighth year, only to revisit it
when famous.</p>
<p>In <i>Lavengro</i> Borrow recalls childish memories of
Canterbury and of Hythe, at which latter place he saw the church
vault filled with ancient skulls as we may see it there
to-day.&nbsp; And after that the book which impressed itself most
vividly upon his memory was <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.&nbsp; How
much he came to revere Defoe the pages of <i>Lavengro</i> most
eloquently reveal to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hail to thee, spirit of
Defoe!&nbsp; What does not my own poor self owe to
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1810&ndash;11 his father was in the
barracks at Norman Cross in Huntingdonshire.&nbsp; Here the
Government had bought a large tract of land, and built upon it a
huge wooden prison, and overlooking this a substantial barrack
also of wood, the only brick building on the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>land being
the house of the Commandant.&nbsp; The great building was
destined for the soldiers taken prisoners in the French
wars.&nbsp; The place was constructed to hold 5000 prisoners, and
500 men were employed by the War Office in 1808 upon its
construction.&nbsp; The first batch of prisoners were the victims
of the battle of Vimeiro in that year.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
description of the hardships of the prisoners has been called in
question by a later writer, Arthur Brown, who denies the story of
bad food and &ldquo;straw-plait hunts,&rdquo; and charges Borrow
with recklessness of statement.&nbsp; &ldquo;What could have been
the matter with the man to write such stuff as this?&rdquo; asks
Brown in reference to Borrow&rsquo;s story of bad meat and bad
bread: which was not treating a great author with quite
sufficient reverence.&nbsp; Borrow was but recalling memories of
childhood, a period when one swallow does make a summer.&nbsp; He
had doubtless seen examples of what he described, although it may
not have been the normal condition of things.&nbsp; Brown&rsquo;s
own description of the Norman Cross prison was interwoven with a
love romance, in which a French officer fell in love with a girl
of the neighbouring village of Yaxley, and after Waterloo
returned to England and married her.&nbsp; When he wrote his
story a very old man was still living at Yaxley, who remembered,
as a boy, having often seen the prisoners on the road, some very
well dressed, some in tatters, a few in uniform.&nbsp; The
milestone is still pointed out which marked the limit beyond
which the officer-prisoners might not walk.&nbsp; The buildings
were destroyed in 1814, when all the prisoners were sent home,
and the house of the Commandant, now a private residence, alone
remains to recall this episode in our history.&nbsp; But
Borrow&rsquo;s most vivid memory of Norman Cross was connected
with the viper given to him by an old man, who had rendered it
harmless by removing the fangs.&nbsp; It was the possession of
this tame viper that enabled the child of eight&mdash;this was
Borrow&rsquo;s age at the time&mdash;to impress the gypsies that
he met soon afterwards, and particularly the boy Ambrose Smith,
whom Borrow introduced to the world in <i>Lavengro</i> as Jasper
Petulengro.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s frequent meetings with
Petulengro are no doubt many of them mythical.&nbsp; He was an
imaginative writer, but Petulengro was a very real person, who
lived the usual roving gypsy life.&nbsp; There is no reason to
assume otherwise than that Borrow did actually meet him <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>at Norman
Cross when he was eight years old, and Ambrose a year younger,
and not thirteen as Borrow states.&nbsp; In the original
manuscript of <i>Lavengro</i> in my possession,
&ldquo;Ambrose&rdquo; is given instead of &ldquo;Jasper,&rdquo;
and the name was altered as an afterthought.&nbsp; It is of
course possible that Borrow did not actually meet Jasper until
his arrival in Norwich, for in the first half of the nineteenth
century various gypsy families were in the habit of assembling
their carts and staking their tents on the heights above Norwich,
known as Mousehold Heath, that glorious tract of country that has
been rendered memorable in history by the tragic life of Kett the
tanner, and has been immortalised in painting by Turner and
Crome.&nbsp; Here were assembled the Smiths and Hernes and
Boswells, names familiar to every student of gypsy lore.&nbsp;
Jasper Petulengro, as Borrow calls him, or Ambrose Smith, to give
him his real name, was the son of F&#257;den Smith, and his name
of Ambrose was derived from his uncle, Ambrose Smith, who was
transported for stealing harness.&nbsp; Ambrose was twice
married, and it was his second wife, Sanspirella Herne, who comes
into the Borrow story.&nbsp; He had families by both his
wives.&nbsp; Ambrose had an extraordinary varied career.&nbsp; It
will be remembered by readers of the <i>Zincali</i> that when he
visited Borrow at Oulton in 1842 he complained that &ldquo;There
is no living for the poor people, brother, the chokengres
(police) pursue us from place to place, and the gorgios are
become either so poor or miserly that they grudge our cattle a
bite of grass by the wayside, and ourselves a yard of ground to
light a fire upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a time Ambrose left the
eastern counties and crossed to Ireland.&nbsp; In 1868 he went to
Scotland, and there seems to have revived his fortunes.&nbsp; In
1878 he and his family were encamped at Knockenhair Park, about a
mile from Dunbar.&nbsp; Here Queen Victoria, who was staying at
Broxmouth Park near by with the Dowager Duchess of Roxburghe,
became interested in the gypsies, and paid them a visit.&nbsp;
This was in the summer of 1878.&nbsp; Ambrose was then a very old
man.&nbsp; He died in the following October.&nbsp; His wife,
Sanspi or Sanspirella, received a message of sympathy from the
Queen.&nbsp; Very shortly after Ambrose&rsquo;s death, however,
most of the family went off to America, where doubtless they are
now scattered, many of them, it may be, leading successful lives,
utterly oblivious of the associations of one <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of their
ancestors with Borrow and his great book.&nbsp; Ambrose Smith was
buried in Dunbar cemetery, the Christian service being read over
his grave, and his friends erected a stone to him which bears the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">In Memory of<br />
<span class="smcap">Ambrose Smith</span>, who died 22nd<br />
October 1878, aged 74 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Also</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>,
his son,<br />
who died 28th May 1879, aged 48 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three years separated the sojourn of the Borrow family at
Norman Cross from their sojourn in Edinburgh&mdash;three years of
continuous wandering.&nbsp; The West Norfolk Militia were
watching the French prisoners at Norman Cross for fifteen
months.&nbsp; After that we have glimpses of them at Colchester,
at East Dereham again, at Harwich, at Leicester, at Huddersfield,
concerning which place Borrow incidentally in <i>Wild Wales</i>
writes of having been at school, in Sheffield, in
Berwick-on-Tweed, and finally the family are in Edinburgh, where
they arrive on 6th April, 1813.&nbsp; We have already referred to
Borrow&rsquo;s presence at the High School of Edinburgh, the
school sanctified by association with Walter Scott and so many of
his illustrious fellow-countrymen.&nbsp; He and his brother were
at the High School for a single session, that is, for the winter
session of 1813&ndash;14, although with the licence of a maker of
fiction he claimed, in <i>Lavengro</i>, to have been there for
two years.&nbsp; But it is not in this brief period of schooling
of a boy of ten that we find the strongest influence that
Edinburgh gave to Borrow.&nbsp; Rather may we seek it in the
acquaintanceship with the once too notorious David Haggart.&nbsp;
Seven years later than this all the peoples of the three kingdoms
were discussing David Haggart, the Scots Jack Sheppard, the
clever young prison-breaker, who was hanged at Edinburgh in 1821
for killing his gaoler in Dumfries prison.&nbsp; How much David
Haggart filled the imagination of every one who could read in the
early years of last century is demonstrated by a reference to the
Library Catalogue of the British Museum, where we find pamphlet
after pamphlet, broadsheet after broadsheet, treating of the
adventures, trial, and execution <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of this youthful gaolbird.&nbsp; But
by far the most valuable publication with regard to Haggart is
one that Borrow must have read in his youth.&nbsp; This was a
life of Haggart written by himself, a little book that had a wide
circulation.&nbsp; From this little biography we learn that
Haggart was born in Golden Acre, near Canon-Mills, in the county
of Edinburgh in 1801, his father, John Haggart, being a
gamekeeper, and in later years a dog-trainer.&nbsp; The boy was
at school under Mr. Robin Gibson at Canon-Mills for two
years.&nbsp; He left school at ten years of age, and from that
time until his execution seems to have had a continuous career of
thieving.&nbsp; He tells us that before he was eleven years old
he had stolen a bantam cock from a woman belonging to the New
Town of Edinburgh.&nbsp; He went with another boy to Currie, six
miles from Edinburgh, and there stole a pony, but this was
afterwards returned.&nbsp; When but twelve years of age he
attended Leith races, and it was here that he enlisted in the
Norfolk Militia, then stationed in Edinburgh Castle.&nbsp; This
may very well have brought him into contact with Borrow in the
way described in <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; He was only, however, in
the regiment for a year, for when it was sent back to England the
Colonel in command of it obtained young Haggart&rsquo;s
discharge.&nbsp; These dates coincide with Borrow&rsquo;s
presence in Edinburgh.&nbsp; Haggart&rsquo;s history for the next
five or six years was in truth merely that of a wandering
pickpocket, sometimes in Scotland, sometimes in England, and
finally he became a notorious burglar.&nbsp; Incidentally he
refers to a girl with whom he was in love.&nbsp; Her name was
Mary Hill.&nbsp; She belonged to Ecclefechan, which Haggart more
than once visited.&nbsp; He must therefore have known Carlyle,
who had not then left his native village.&nbsp; In 1820 we find
him in Edinburgh, carrying on the same sort of depredations both
there and at Leith&mdash;now he steals a silk plaid, now a
greatcoat, and now a silver teapot.&nbsp; These thefts, of
course, landed him in gaol, out of which he breaks rather
dramatically, fleeing with a companion to Kelso.&nbsp; He had,
indeed, more than one experience of gaol.&nbsp; Finally, we find
him in the prison of Dumfries destined to stand his trial for
&ldquo;one act of house-breaking, eleven cases of theft, and one
of prison-breaking.&rdquo;&nbsp; While in prison at Dumfries he
planned another escape, and in the attempt to hit a gaoler named
Morrin on the head with a stone he unexpectedly killed him.&nbsp;
His <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>escape
from Dumfries gaol after this murder, and his later wanderings,
are the most dramatic part of his book.&nbsp; He fled through
Carlisle to Newcastle, and then thought that he would be safer if
he returned to Scotland, where he found the rewards that were
offered for his arrest faced him wherever he went.&nbsp; He
turned up again in Edinburgh, where he seems to have gone about
freely, although reading everywhere the notices that a reward of
seventy guineas was offered for his apprehension.&nbsp; Then he
fled to Ireland, where he thought that his safety was
assured.&nbsp; At Dromore he was arrested and brought before the
magistrate, but he spoke with an Irish brogue, and declared that
his name was John M&lsquo;Colgan, and that he came from
Armagh.&nbsp; He escaped from Dromore gaol by jumping through a
window, and actually went so far as to pay three pound ten
shillings for his passage to America, but he was afraid of the
sea, and changed his mind, and lost his passage money at the last
moment.&nbsp; After this he made a tour right through Ireland, in
spite of the fact that the Dublin <i>Hue and Cry</i> had a
description of his person which he read more than once.&nbsp; His
assurance was such that in Tullamore he made a pig-driver
apologise before the magistrate for charging him with theft,
although he had been living on nothing else all the time he was
in Ireland.&nbsp; Finally, he was captured, being recognised by a
policeman from Edinburgh.&nbsp; He was brought from Ireland to
Dumfries, landed in Calton gaol, Edinburgh, and was tried and
executed.</p>
<p>We may pass over the brief sojourn in Norwich that was
Borrow&rsquo;s lot in 1814, when the West Norfolk Militia left
Scotland.&nbsp; When Napoleon escaped from Elba the West Norfolk
Regiment was despatched to Ireland, and Captain Borrow again took
his family with him.&nbsp; We find the boy with his family at
Clonmel from May to December of 1815.&nbsp; Here Borrow&rsquo;s
elder brother, now a boy of fifteen, was promoted from Ensign to
Lieutenant.&nbsp; In January, 1816, the Borrows moved to
Templemore, returning to England in May of that year.&nbsp;
Borrow, we see, was less than a year in Ireland, and he was only
thirteen years of age when he left the country.&nbsp; But it
seems to have been the greatest influence that guided his
career.&nbsp; Three of the most fascinating chapters in
<i>Lavengro</i> were one outcome of that brief sojourn, a thirst
for the acquirement of languages was another, and perhaps a taste
for romancing a third.&nbsp; Borrow never came to have the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>least
sympathy with the Irish race, or its national aspirations.&nbsp;
As the son of a half-educated soldier he did not come in contact
with any but the vagabond element of Ireland, exactly as his
father had done before him.&nbsp; Captain Borrow was asked on one
occasion what language is being spoken:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Irish,&rdquo; said my father with a loud
voice, &ldquo;and a bad language it is. . . .&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
one part of London where all the Irish live&mdash;at least the
worst of them&mdash;and there they hatch their villainies to
speak this tongue.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Borrow followed his father&rsquo;s prejudices throughout
his life, although in the one happy year in which he wrote <i>The
Bible in Spain</i> he was able to do justice to the country that
had inspired so much of his work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Honour to Ireland and her &ldquo;hundred thousand
welcomes&rdquo;!&nbsp; Her fields have long been the greenest in
the world; her daughters the fairest; her sons the bravest and
most eloquent.&nbsp; May they never cease to be so. <a
name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a"
class="citation">[33a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In later years Orangemen were to him the only attractive
element in the life of Ireland, and we may be sure that he was
not displeased when his stepdaughter married one of them.&nbsp;
Yet the creator of literature works more wisely than he knows,
and Borrow&rsquo;s books have won the wise and benign
appreciation of many an Irish and Roman Catholic reader, whose
nationality and religion Borrow would have anathematised.&nbsp;
Irishmen may forgive Borrow much, because he was one of the first
of modern English writers to take their language seriously. <a
name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a>&nbsp; It is true that he had but the
most superficial knowledge of it.&nbsp; He admits&mdash;in
<i>Wild Wales</i>&mdash;that he only knew it &ldquo;by
ear.&rdquo;&nbsp; The abundant Irish literature that has been so
diligently studied during the last quarter of a century was a
closed book to Borrow, whose few translations from the Irish have
but little value.&nbsp; Yet <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the very appreciation of Irish as a
language to be seriously studied in days before Dr. George
Sigerson and Dr. Douglas Hyde had waxed enthusiastic and
practical kindles our gratitude.&nbsp; Then what a character is
Murtagh.&nbsp; We are sure there was a Murtagh, although, unlike
Borrow&rsquo;s other boyish and vagabond friend Haggart, we know
nothing about him but what Borrow has to tell.&nbsp; Yet what a
picture is this where Murtagh wants a pack of cards:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I say, Murtagh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Shorsha dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a pack of cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so, Shorsha ma vourneen?&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t say that you have cards fifty-two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, though; and they are quite new&mdash;never been
once used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be lending them to me, I
warrant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think it!&mdash;But I&rsquo;ll sell them to
you, joy, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanam mon Dioul! am I not after telling you that I have
no money at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have as good as money, to me, at least; and
I&rsquo;ll take it in exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Shorsha dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you speak Irish; I heard you talking it the other
day to the cripple.&nbsp; You shall teach me Irish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it a language-master you&rsquo;d be making of
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure!&mdash;what better can you do?&mdash;it
would help you to pass your time at school.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
learn Greek, so you must teach Irish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Christmas, Murtagh was playing at cards with his
brother Denis, and I could speak a considerable quantity of
broken Irish. <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With what distrust as we learn again and again in
<i>Lavengro</i> did Captain Borrow follow his son&rsquo;s
inclination towards languages, and especially the Irish language,
in his early years, although anxious that he should be well
grounded in Latin.&nbsp; Little did the worthy Captain dream that
this, and this alone, was to carry down his name through the
ages:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ah, that Irish!&nbsp; How frequently do
circumstances, at first sight the most trivial and unimportant,
exercise a mighty and permanent influence on our habits and
pursuits!&mdash;how frequently is a stream turned aside from its
natural course by some little rock or knoll, causing it to make
an abrupt turn!&nbsp; On a wild <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>road in Ireland I had heard Irish
spoken for the first time; and I was seized with a desire to
learn Irish, the acquisition of which, in my case, became the
stepping-stone to other languages.&nbsp; I had previously learnt
Latin, or rather Lilly; but neither Latin nor Lilly made me a
philologist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was never a philologist, but this first inclination for
Irish was to lead him later to Spanish, to Welsh, and above all
to Romany, and to make of him the most beloved traveller and the
strangest vagabond in all English literature.</p>

36</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smcap">The Gurneys and the Taylors of
Norwich</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Norwich</span> may claim to be one of the
most fascinating cities in the kingdom.&nbsp; To-day it is known
to the wide world by its canaries and its mustard, although its
most important industry is the boot trade, in which it employs
some eight thousand persons.&nbsp; To the visitor it has many
attractions.&nbsp; The lovely cathedral with its fine Norman
arches, the Erpingham Gate so splendidly Gothic, the noble Castle
Keep so imposingly placed with the cattle-market
below&mdash;these are all as Borrow saw them nearly a century
ago.&nbsp; So also is the church of St. Peter Mancroft, where Sir
Thomas Browne lies buried.&nbsp; And to the picturesque Mousehold
Heath you may still climb and recall one of the first struggles
for liberty and progress that past ages have seen, the Norfolk
rising under Robert Kett which has only not been glorified in
song and in picture, because&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Treason doth never prosper&mdash;what&rsquo;s the
reason?<br />
Why if it prosper none dare call it treason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Kett&rsquo;s so-called rebellion was destined to failure,
and its leader to cruel martyrdom.&nbsp; Mousehold Heath has been
made the subject of paintings by Turner and Crome, and of fine
word pictures by George Borrow.&nbsp; When Borrow and his parents
lighted upon Norwich in 1814 and 1816 the city had inspiring
literary associations.&nbsp; Before the invention of railways it
seemed not uncommon for a fine intellectual life to emanate from
this or that cathedral city.&nbsp; Such an intellectual life was
associated with Lichfield when the Darwins and the Edgeworths
gathered at the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace around Dr. Seward and his
accomplished daughters.&nbsp; Norwich has more than once been
such a centre.&nbsp; The first occasion was in the period of
which we write, when the Taylors and the Gurneys flourished in a
region of ideas; the second was during the years from 1837 to
1849, when <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Edward Stanley held the bishopric.&nbsp; This later
period does not come into our story, as by that time Borrow had
all but left Norwich.&nbsp; But of the earlier period, the period
of Borrow&rsquo;s more or less fitful residence in
Norwich&mdash;1814 to 1833&mdash;we are tempted to write at some
length.&nbsp; There were three separate literary and social
forces in Norwich in the first decades of the nineteenth
century&mdash;the Gurneys of Earlham, the Taylor-Austin group,
and William Taylor, who was in no way related to Mrs. John Taylor
and her daughter, Sarah Austin.&nbsp; The Gurneys were truly a
remarkable family, destined to leave their impress upon Norwich
and upon a wider world.&nbsp; At the time of his marriage in 1773
to Catherine Bell, John Gurney, wool-stapler of Norwich, took his
young wife, whose face has been preserved in a canvas by
Gainsborough, to live in the old Court House in Magdalen Street,
which had been the home of two generations of the Gurney
family.&nbsp; In 1786 John Gurney went with his continually
growing family to live at Earlham Hall, some two or three miles
out of Norwich on the Earlham Road.&nbsp; Here that family of
eleven children&mdash;one boy had died in infancy&mdash;grew
up.&nbsp; Not one but has an interesting history, which is
recorded by Mr. Augustus Hare and other writers.&nbsp; Elizabeth,
the fourth daughter, married Joseph Fry, and as Elizabeth Fry
attained to a world-wide fame as a prison reformer.&nbsp; Hannah
married Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton of Slave Trade Abolition;
Richenda, the Rev. Francis Cunningham, who sent George Borrow
upon his career; while Louisa married Samuel Hoare of
Hampstead.&nbsp; Of her Joseph John Gurney said at her death in
1836 that she was &ldquo;superior in point of talent to any other
of my father&rsquo;s eleven children.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is with the
eleventh child, however, that we have mainly to do, for this son,
Joseph John Gurney, alone appears in Borrow&rsquo;s pages.&nbsp;
The picture of these eleven Quaker children growing up to their
various destinies under the roof of Earlham Hall is an attractive
one.&nbsp; Men and women of all creeds accepted the catholic
Quaker&rsquo;s hospitality.&nbsp; Mrs. Opie and a long list of
worthies of the past come before us, and when Mr. Gurney, in
1802, took his six unmarried daughters to the Lakes Old Crome
accompanied them as drawing-master.</p>
<p>In 1803&mdash;the year of Borrow&rsquo;s birth&mdash;John
Gurney became a partner in the great London Bank of Overend <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and Gurney,
and his son, Joseph John, in that same year went up to
Oxford.&nbsp; In 1809 Joseph returned to take his place in the
bank, and to preside over the family of unmarried sisters at
Earlham, father and mother being dead, and many members of the
family distributed.&nbsp; Incidentally, we are told by Mr. Hare
that the Gurneys of Earlham at this time drove out with four
black horses, and that when Bishop Bathurst, Stanley&rsquo;s
predecessor, required horses for State occasions to drive him to
the cathedral, he borrowed these, and the more modest episcopal
horses took the Quaker family to their meeting-house.&nbsp; It
does not come within the scope of this book to trace the fortunes
of these eleven remarkable Gurney children, or even of
Borrow&rsquo;s momentary acquaintance, Joseph John Gurney.&nbsp;
His residence at Earlham, and his life of philanthropy, are a
romance in a way, although one wonders whether if the name of
Gurney had not been associated with so much of virtue and
goodness the crash that came long after Joseph John
Gurney&rsquo;s death would have been quite so full of affliction
for a vast multitude.&nbsp; Joseph John Gurney died in 1847, in
his fifty-ninth year; his sister, Mrs. Fry, had died two years
earlier.&nbsp; The younger brother and twelfth child&mdash;Joseph
John being the eleventh&mdash;Daniel Gurney, the last of the
twelve children, lived till 1880, aged eighty-nine.&nbsp; He had
outlived by many years the catastrophe to the great banking firm
with which the name of Gurney is associated.&nbsp; This great
firm of Overend and Gurney, of which yet another brother, Samuel,
was the moving spirit, was organised nine years after his
death&mdash;in 1865&mdash;into a joint-stock company, which
failed to the amount of eleven millions in 1866.&nbsp; At the
time of the failure, which affected all England, much as did the
Liberator smash a generation later, the only Gurney in the
directorate was Daniel Gurney, to whom his sister, Lady Buxton,
allowed a pension of &pound;2000 a year.&nbsp; This is a long
story to tell by way of introduction to one episode in
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; This episode had place in the year 1817,
when Borrow was but fourteen years of age and Gurney was
twenty-nine.&nbsp; It is doubtful if Borrow met Joseph John
Gurney more than on the one occasion.&nbsp; At the commencement
of his engagement with the Bible Society he writes to its
secretary, Mr. Jowett (18th March, 1833), to say that he must
procure from Mr. Cunningham &ldquo;a letter of introduction from
him to John <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Gurney,&rdquo; and this second and last interview must
have taken place at Earlham before his departure for Russia.</p>
<p>But if Borrow was to come very little under the influence of
Joseph John Gurney, his destiny was to be considerably moulded by
the action of Gurney&rsquo;s brother-in-law, Cunningham, who
first put him in touch with the Bible Society.&nbsp; Joseph John
Gurney and his sisters were the very life of the Bible Society in
those years.</p>
<p>With the famous &ldquo;Taylors of Norwich&rdquo; Borrow seems
to have had no acquaintance, although he went to school with a
connection of that family, James Martineau.&nbsp; These socially
important Taylors were in no way related to William Taylor of
that city, who knew German literature, and scandalised the more
virtuous citizens by that, and perhaps more by his fondness for
wine and also for good English beer&mdash;a drink over which his
friend Borrow was to become lyrical.&nbsp; When people speak of
the Norwich Taylors they refer to the family of Dr. John Taylor,
who in 1733 was elected to the charge of the Presbyterian
congregation in Norwich.&nbsp; His eldest son, Richard, married
Margaret, the daughter of a mayor of Norwich of the name of
Meadows; and Sarah, another daughter of that same worshipful
mayor, married David Martineau, grandson of Gaston Martineau, who
fled from France at the time of the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes. <a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a>&nbsp; Harriet and James Martineau were
grandchildren of this David.&nbsp; The second son of Richard and
Margaret Taylor was John, who married Susannah Cook.&nbsp;
Susannah is the clever Mrs. John Taylor of this story, and her
daughter of even greater ability was Sarah Austin, the wife of
the famous jurist.&nbsp; Here we are only concerned with Mrs.
John Taylor, called by her friends the &ldquo;Madame Roland of
Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lucy Aikin describes how she &ldquo;darned
her boy&rsquo;s grey worsted stockings while holding her own with
Southey, Brougham, or Mackintosh.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of her
daughters married Henry Reeve, and, as I have said, another
married John Austin.&nbsp; Borrow was twenty years of age and
living in Norwich when Mrs. Taylor died.&nbsp; It is to be
regretted that in the early impressionable years his position as
a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk did not allow of his coming into a circle
in which he might have gained certain qualities of <i>savoir
faire</i> and <i>joie de vivre</i>, which he was all his days to
lack.&nbsp; Of the Taylor family <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>the Duke of Sussex said that they
reversed the ordinary saying that it takes nine tailors to make a
man.&nbsp; The witticism has been attributed to Sydney Smith, but
Mrs. Ross gives evidence that it was the Duke&rsquo;s&mdash;the
youngest son of George III.&nbsp; In his <i>Life of Sir James
Mackintosh</i> Basil Montagu, referring to Mrs. John Taylor,
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Norwich was always a haven of rest to us, from the
literary society with which that city abounded.&nbsp; Dr. Sayers
we used to visit, and the high-minded and intelligent William
Taylor; but our chief delight was in the society of Mrs. John
Taylor, a most intelligent and excellent woman, mild and
unassuming, quiet and meek, sitting amidst her large family,
occupied with her needle and domestic occupations, but always
assisting, by her great knowledge, the advancement of kind and
dignified sentiment and conduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We note here the reference to &ldquo;the high-minded and
intelligent William Taylor,&rdquo; because William Taylor, whose
influence upon Borrow&rsquo;s destiny was so pronounced, has been
revealed to many by the slanders of Harriet Martineau, that
extraordinary compound of meanness and generosity, of
poverty-stricken intelligence and rich endowment.&nbsp; In her
<i>Autobiography</i>, published in 1877, thirty-four years after
Robberds&rsquo;s <i>Memoir of William Taylor</i>, she dwells upon
the drinking propensities of William Taylor, who was a
schoolfellow of her father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She admits, indeed,
that Taylor was an ideal son, whose &ldquo;exemplary filial duty
was a fine spectacle to the whole city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Taylor&rsquo;s life is pleasantly interlinked with
Scott and Southey.&nbsp; Lucy Aikin records that she heard Sir
Walter Scott declare to Mrs. Barbauld that Taylor had laid the
foundations of his literary career&mdash;had started him upon the
path of glory through romantic verse to romantic prose, from
<i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> to <i>Waverley</i>.&nbsp; It
was the reading of Taylor&rsquo;s translation of
B&uuml;rger&rsquo;s <i>Lenore</i> that did all this.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This, madam,&rdquo; said Scott, &ldquo;was what made me a
poet.&nbsp; I had several times attempted the more regular kinds
of poetry without success, but here was something that I thought
I could do.&rdquo;&nbsp; Southey assuredly loved Taylor, and each
threw at the feet of the other the abundant literary learning
that both possessed.&nbsp; This we find in a correspondence
which, reading more than a century after it was written, still
has its charm.&nbsp; The son of a wealthy manufacturer of <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Norwich,
Taylor was born in that city in 1765.&nbsp; He was in early years
a pupil of Mrs. Barbauld.&nbsp; At fourteen he was placed in his
father&rsquo;s counting-house, and soon afterwards was sent
abroad, in the company of one of the partners, to acquire
languages.&nbsp; He learnt German thoroughly at a time when few
Englishmen had acquaintance with its literature.&nbsp; To
Goethe&rsquo;s genius he never did justice, having been offended
by that great man&rsquo;s failure to acknowledge a book that
Taylor sent to him, exactly as Carlyle and Borrow alike were
afterwards offended by similar delinquencies on the part of
Walter Scott.&nbsp; When he settled again in Norwich he commenced
to write for the magazines, among others for Sir Richard
Phillips&rsquo;s <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, and to correspond with
Southey.&nbsp; At the time Southey was a poor man, thinking of
abandoning literature for the law, and hopeful of practising in
Calcutta.&nbsp; The Norwich Liberals, however, aspired to a
newspaper to be called <i>The Iris</i>.&nbsp; Taylor asked
Southey to come to Norwich and to become its editor.&nbsp;
Southey declined and Taylor took up the task, The <i>Norwich
Iris</i> lasted for two years.&nbsp; Southey never threw over his
friendship for Taylor, although their views ultimately came to be
far apart.&nbsp; Writing to Taylor in 1803 he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your theology does nothing but mischief; it serves
only to thin the miserable ranks of Unitarianism.&nbsp; The
regular troops of infidelity do little harm; and their
trumpeters, such as Voltaire and Paine, not much more.&nbsp; But
it is such pioneers as Middleton, and you and your German
friends, that work underground and sap the very citadel.&nbsp;
That <i>Monthly Magazine</i> is read by all the
Dissenters&mdash;I call it the Dissenters&rsquo;
Obituary&mdash;and here are you eternally mining, mining, under
the shallow faith of their half-learned, half-witted, half-paid,
half-starved pastors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the correspondence went on apace, indeed it occupies the
larger part of Robberds&rsquo;s two substantial volumes.&nbsp; It
is in the very last letter from Taylor to Southey that we find an
oft-quoted reference to Borrow.&nbsp; The letter is dated 12th
March, 1821:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Norwich young man is construing with me
Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Wilhelm Tell</i> with the view of translating
it for the Press.&nbsp; His name is George Henry Borrow, and he
has learnt German with extraordinary rapidity; indeed, he has the
gift of tongues, and, though not yet eighteen, understands twelve
languages&mdash;English, <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Welsh, Erse, Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
German, Danish, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese; he
would like to get into the Office for Foreign Affairs, but does
not know how.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this was the last letter to Southey that is published
in the memoir, Taylor visited Southey at Keswick in 1826.&nbsp;
Taylor&rsquo;s three volumes of the <i>Historic Survey of German
Poetry</i> appeared in 1828, 1829, and 1830.&nbsp; Sir Walter
Scott, in the last year of his life, wrote from Abbotsford on
23rd April, 1832, to Taylor to protest against an allusion to
&ldquo;William Scott of Edinburgh&rdquo; being the author of a
translation of <i>Goetz von Berlichingen</i>.&nbsp; Scott
explained that he (Walter Scott) was that author, and also made
allusion to the fact that he had borrowed with acknowledgment two
lines from Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Lenore</i> for his own&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Tramp, tramp along the land,<br />
Splash, splash across the sea,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>adding that his recollection of the obligation was infinitely
stronger than of the mistake.&nbsp; It would seem, however, that
the name &ldquo;William&rdquo; was actually on the title-page of
the London edition of 1799 of <i>Goetz von
Berlichingen</i>.&nbsp; When Southey heard of the death of Taylor
in 1836 he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was not aware of my old friend&rsquo;s illness,
or I should certainly have written to him, to express that
unabated regard which I have felt for him eight-and-thirty years,
and that hope which I shall ever feel, that we may meet in the
higher state of existence.&nbsp; I have known very few who
equalled him in talents&mdash;none who had a kinder heart; and
there never lived a more dutiful son, or a sincerer friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s many books are now all forgotten.&nbsp; His
translation of B&uuml;rger&rsquo;s <i>Lenore</i> one now only
recalls by its effect upon Scott; his translation of
Lessing&rsquo;s <i>Nathan the Wise</i> has been superseded.&nbsp;
His voluminous <i>Historic Survey of German Poetry</i> only lives
through Carlyle&rsquo;s severe review in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> <a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a> against the many strictures in which
Taylor&rsquo;s biographer attempts to defend him.&nbsp; Taylor
had none of Carlyle&rsquo;s inspiration.&nbsp; Not a line of his
work survives in print in our day, but it was no small thing to
have been the friend and correspondent of Southey, whose figure
in literary history looms larger now than it did when <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Emerson asked
contemptuously, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Southey?&rdquo;; and to have
been the wise mentor of George Borrow is in itself to be no small
thing in the record of letters.&nbsp; There is a considerable
correspondence between Taylor and Sir Richard Phillips in
Robberds&rsquo;s <i>Memoir</i>, and Phillips seemed always
anxious to secure articles from Taylor for the <i>Monthly</i>,
and even books for his publishing-house.&nbsp; Hence the
introduction from Taylor that Borrow carried to London might have
been most effective if Phillips had had any use for poor and
impracticable would-be authors.</p>

44</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smcap">At the Norwich Grammar School</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> George Borrow first entered
Norwich after the long journey from Edinburgh, Joseph John
Gurney, born 1788, was twenty-six years of age, and William
Taylor, born 1765, was forty-nine.&nbsp; Borrow was eleven years
of age.&nbsp; Captain Borrow took temporary lodgings at the Crown
and Angel Inn in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Street, George was sent to
the Grammar School, and his elder brother started to learn
drawing and painting with John Crome (&ldquo;Old Crome&rdquo;) of
many a fine landscape.&nbsp; But the wanderings of the family
were not yet over.&nbsp; Napoleon escaped from Elba, and the West
Norfolk Militia were again put on the march.&nbsp; This time it
was Ireland to which they were destined, and we have already
shadowed forth, with the help of <i>Lavengro</i>, that momentous
episode.&nbsp; The victory of Waterloo gave Europe peace, and in
1816 the Borrow family returned to Norwich, there to pass many
quiet years.&nbsp; In 1819 Captain Borrow was
pensioned&mdash;eight shillings a day.&nbsp; From 1816 till his
father&rsquo;s death in 1824 Borrow lived in Norwich with his
family.&nbsp; Their home was in King&rsquo;s Court, Willow Lane,
a modest one-storey house in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>, which we have
already described.&nbsp; In King&rsquo;s Court, Willow Lane,
Borrow lived at intervals until his marriage in 1840, and his
mother continued to live in the house until, in 1849, she agreed
to join her son and daughter-in-law at Oulton.&nbsp; Yet the
house comes little into the story of Borrow&rsquo;s life, as do
the early houses of many great men of letters, nor do subsequent
houses come into his story; the house at Oulton and the house at
Hereford Square are equally barren of association; the broad
highway and the windy heath were Borrow&rsquo;s natural
home.&nbsp; He was never a &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; being; he
never shone in drawing-rooms.&nbsp; Let us, however, return to
Borrow&rsquo;s school-days, of which the records are all too
scanty, and not in the least invigorating.&nbsp; <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>The Norwich
Grammar School has an interesting tradition.&nbsp; We pass to the
cathedral through the beautiful Erpingham Gate built about 1420
by Sir Thomas Erpingham, and we find the school on the
left.&nbsp; It was originally a chapel, and the porch is at least
five hundred years old.&nbsp; The schoolroom is sufficiently
old-world-looking for us to imagine the schoolboys of past
generations sitting at the various desks.&nbsp; The school was
founded in 1547, but the registers have been lost, and so we know
little of its famous pupils of earlier days.&nbsp; Lord Nelson
and Rajah Brooke are the two names of men of action that stand
out most honourably in modern times among the scholars.&nbsp; In
literature Borrow had but one schoolfellow, who afterwards came
to distinction&mdash;James Martineau.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s
headmaster was the Reverend Edward Valpy, who held the office
from 1810 to 1829, and to whom is credited the destruction of the
school archives.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s two years of the Grammar
School were not happy ones.&nbsp; Borrow, as we have shown, was
not of the stuff of which happy schoolboys are made.&nbsp; He had
been a wanderer&mdash;Scotland, Ireland, and many parts of
England had assisted in a fragmentary education; he was now
thirteen years of age, and already a vagabond at heart.&nbsp; But
let us hear Dr. Augustus Jessopp, who was headmaster of the same
Grammar School from 1859 to 1879.&nbsp; Writing of a meeting of
old Norvicensians to greet the Rajah, Sir James Brooke, in 1858,
when there was a great &ldquo;whip&rdquo; of the &ldquo;old
boys,&rdquo; Dr. Jessopp tells us that Borrow, then living at
Yarmouth, did not put in an appearance among his
schoolfellows:</p>
<blockquote><p>My belief is that he never was popular among them,
that he never attained a high place in the school, and he was a
&ldquo;free boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; In those days there were a certain
number of day boys at Norwich school, who were nominated by
members of the Corporation, and who paid no tuition fees; they
had to submit to a certain amount of snubbing at the hands of the
boarders, who for the most part were the sons of the county
gentry.&nbsp; Of course, such a proud boy as George Borrow would
resent this, and it seems to have rankled with him all through
his life. . . .&nbsp; To talk of Borrow as a
&ldquo;scholar&rdquo; is absurd.&nbsp; &ldquo;A picker-up of
learning&rsquo;s crumbs&rdquo; he was, but he was absolutely
without any of the training or the instincts of a scholar.&nbsp;
He had had little education till he came to Norwich, and was at
the Grammar School little more than two years.&nbsp; It is pretty
certain that he knew no Greek when he entered there, and he never
seems to have acquired more than the elements of that
language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Yet the
only real influence that Borrow carried away from the Grammar
School was concerned with foreign languages.&nbsp; He did take to
the French master and exiled priest, Thomas d&rsquo;Eterville, a
native of Caen, who had emigrated to Norwich in 1793.&nbsp;
D&rsquo;Eterville taught French, Italian, and apparently, to
Borrow, a little Spanish; and Borrow, with his wonderful memory,
must have been his favourite pupil.&nbsp; In the fourteenth and
fifteenth chapters of <i>Lavengro</i> he is pleasantly described
by his pupil, who adds, with characteristic &ldquo;bluff,&rdquo;
that d&rsquo;Eterville said &ldquo;on our arrival at the
conclusion of Dante&rsquo;s <i>Hell</i>, &lsquo;vous serez un
jour un grand philologue, mon cher.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s biographers have dwelt at length upon one
episode of his schooldays&mdash;the flogging he received from
Valpy for playing truant with three other boys.&nbsp; One, by
name John Dalrymple, faltered on the way, the two faithful
followers of George in his escapade being two brothers named
Theodosius and Francis Purland, whose father kept a
chemist&rsquo;s shop in Norwich.&nbsp; The three boys wandered
away as far as Acle, eleven miles from Norwich, whence they were
ignominiously brought back and birched.&nbsp; John
Dalrymple&rsquo;s brother Arthur, son of a distinguished Norwich
surgeon, who became Clerk of the Peace at Norwich in 1854, and
died in 1868, has left a memorandum concerning Borrow, from which
I take the following extract:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was at school with Borrow at the Free School,
Norwich, under the Rev. E. Valpy.&nbsp; He was an odd, wild boy,
and always wanting to turn Robinson Crusoe or Buccaneer.&nbsp; My
brother John was about Borrow&rsquo;s age, and on one occasion
Borrow, John, and another, whose name I forget, determined to run
away and turn pirates.&nbsp; John carried an old horse pistol and
some potatoes as his contribution to the general stock, but his
zeal was soon exhausted, he turned back at Thorpe Lunatic Asylum;
but Borrow went off to Yarmouth, and lived on the Caister Denes
for a few days.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember hearing of any
exploits.&nbsp; He had a wonderful facility for learning
languages, which, however, he never appears to have turned to
account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James Martineau, afterwards a popular preacher and a
distinguished theologian of the Unitarian creed, here comes into
the story.&nbsp; He was a contemporary with Borrow at the Norwich
Grammar School as already stated, but the two boys had little in
common.&nbsp; There was nothing of the vagabond about James
Martineau, and concerning Borrow&mdash;<a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>if on no other subject&mdash;he would
probably have agreed with his sister Harriet, whose views we
shall quote in a later chapter.&nbsp; In Martineau&rsquo;s
<i>Memoirs</i>, voluminous and dull, there is only one reference
to Borrow; <a name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a> but a correspondent once ventured to
approach the eminent divine concerning the rumour as to
Martineau&rsquo;s part in the birching of the author of <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, and received the following letter:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">35 <span
class="smcap">Gordon Square</span>, <span
class="smcap">London</span>, W.C., <i>December</i> 6, 1895.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Two or three years
ago Mr. Egmont Hake (author, I think, of a life of Gordon) sought
an interview with me, as reputed to be Borrow&rsquo;s sole
surviving schoolfellow, in order to gather information or test
traditions about his schooldays.&nbsp; This was with a view to a
memoir which he was compiling, he said, out of the literary
remains which had been committed to him by his executors.&nbsp; I
communicated to him such recollections as I could clearly depend
upon and leave at his disposal for publication or for suppression
as he might think fit.&nbsp; Under these circumstances I feel
that they are rightfully his, and that I am restrained from
placing them at disposal elsewhere unless and until he renounces
his claim upon them.&nbsp; But though I cannot repeat them at
length for public use, I am not precluded from correcting
inaccuracies in stories already in circulation, and may therefore
say that Mr. Arthur Dalrymple&rsquo;s version of the Yarmouth
escapade is wrong in making his brother John a partner in the
transaction.&nbsp; John had quite too much sense for that; the
only victims of Borrow&rsquo;s romance were two or three silly
boys&mdash;mere lackeys of Borrow&rsquo;s commanding
will&mdash;who helped him to make up a kit for the common
knapsack by pilferings out of their fathers&rsquo; shops.</p>
<p>The Norwich gentleman who fell in with the boys lying in the
hedgerow near the half-way inn knew one of them, and wormed out
of him the drift of their enterprise, and engaging a postchaise
packed them all into it, and in his gig saw them safe home.</p>
<p>It is true that I had to <i>hoist</i> (not
&ldquo;horse&rdquo;) Borrow for his flogging, but not that there
was anything exceptional or capable of leaving permanent scars in
the infliction.&nbsp; Mr. Valpy was not given to excess of that
kind.</p>
<p>I have never read <i>Lavengro</i>, and cannot give any opinion
about the correct spelling of the &ldquo;Exul sacerdos&rdquo;
name.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s romance and William Taylor&rsquo;s love of
paradox would doubtless often run together, like a pair of
well-matched steeds, and carry them away in the same
direction.&nbsp; But there was a strong&mdash;almost
wild&mdash;<i>religious</i> sentiment in Borrow, of which only
faint traces appear in W. T.&nbsp; In Borrow it had always a
tendency to pass from a sympathetic to an antipathetic
form.&nbsp; He <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>used to gather about him three or four favourite
schoolfellows, after they had learned their class lesson and
before the class was called up, and with a sheet of paper and
book on his knee, invent and tell a story, making rapid little
pictures of each <i>dramatis persona</i> that came upon the
stage.&nbsp; The plot was woven and spread out with much
ingenuity, and the characters were various and well
discriminated.&nbsp; But two of them were sure to turn up in
every tale, the Devil and the Pope, and the working of the drama
invariably had the same issue&mdash;the utter ruin and disgrace
of these two potentates.&nbsp; I had often thought that there was
a presage here of the mission which produced <i>The Bible in
Spain.</i>&mdash;I am, dear sir, very truly yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">James
Martineau</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet it is amusing to trace the story through various
phases.&nbsp; Dr. Martineau&rsquo;s letter was the outcome of his
attention being called to a statement made in a letter written by
a lady in Hampstead to a friend in Norwich, which runs as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">11<i>th</i> Nov.
1893.</p>
<p>Dr. Martineau, to amuse some boys at a school treat, told us
about George Borrow, his schoolfellow: he was always reading
adventures of smugglers and pirates, etc., and at last, to carry
out his ideas, got a set of his schoolfellows to promise to join
him in an expedition to Yarmouth, where he had heard of a ship
that he thought would take them.&nbsp; The boys saved all the
food they could from their meals, and what money they had, and
one morning started very early to walk to Yarmouth.&nbsp; They
got halfway&mdash;to Blofield, I think&mdash;when they were so
tired they had to rest by the roadside, and eat their
lunch.&nbsp; While they were resting a gentleman, whose son was
at the Free School, passed in his gig.&nbsp; He thought it was
very odd so many boys, some of whom he had seen, should be
waiting about, so he drove back and asked them if they would come
to dine with him at the inn.&nbsp; Of course they were only too
glad, poor boys: but as soon as he had got them all in he sent
his servant with a letter to Mr. Valpy, who sent a coach and
brought them all back.&nbsp; You know what a cruel man that Dr.
V. was.&nbsp; He made Dr. Martineau take poor Borrow on his back,
&ldquo;horse him,&rdquo; I think he called it, and flogged him so
that Dr. M. said he would carry the marks for the rest of his
life, and he had to keep his bed for a fortnight.&nbsp; The other
boys got off with lighter punishment, but Borrow was the
ringleader.&nbsp; Those were the &ldquo;good old
times&rdquo;!&nbsp; I have heard Dr. M. say that not for another
life would he go through the misery he suffered as &ldquo;town
boy&rdquo; at that school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Frances Power Cobbe, who lived next door to Borrow in
Hereford Square, Brompton, in the &rsquo;sixties, as we shall see
later, has a word to say on the point:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Dr. Martineau once told me that he and Borrow had been
schoolfellows at Norwich some sixty years before.&nbsp; Borrow
had persuaded several of his other companions to rob their
fathers&rsquo; tills, and then the party set forth to join some
smugglers on the coast.&nbsp; By degrees the truants all fell out
of line and were picked up, tired and hungry, along the road, and
brought back to Norwich School, where condign chastisement
awaited them.&nbsp; George Borrow, it seems, received his large
share <i>horsed</i> on James Martineau&rsquo;s back!&nbsp; The
early connection between the two old men, as I knew them, was
irresistibly comic to my mind.&nbsp; Somehow when I asked Mr.
Borrow once to come and meet some friends at our house he
accepted our invitation as usual, but, on finding that Dr.
Martineau was to be of the party, hastily withdrew his acceptance
on a transparent excuse; nor did he ever after attend our little
assemblies without first ascertaining that Dr. Martineau was not
to be present. <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Valpy of the Norwich Grammar School is scarcely to be
blamed that he was not able to make separate rules for a quite
abnormal boy.&nbsp; Yet, if he could have known, Borrow was
better employed playing truant and living up to his life-work as
a glorified vagabond than in studying in the ordinary school
routine.&nbsp; George Borrow belonged to a type of
boy&mdash;there are many such&mdash;who learn much more out of
school than in its bounds; and the boy Borrow, picking up brother
vagabonds in Tombland Fair, and already beginning, in his own
peculiar way, his language craze, was laying the foundations that
made <i>Lavengro</i> possible.</p>

50</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smcap">In a Lawyer&rsquo;s Office</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Doubts</span> were very frequently
expressed in Borrow&rsquo;s lifetime as to his having really been
articled to a solicitor, but that point has been set at rest by
reference to the Record Office.&nbsp; Borrow was articled to
Simpson and Rackham of Tuck&rsquo;s Court, St. Giles&rsquo;s,
Norwich, &ldquo;for the term of five years&rdquo;&mdash;from
March, 1819, to March, 1824,&mdash;and these five years were
spent in and about Norwich, and were full of adventure of a kind
with which the law had nothing to do.&nbsp; If Borrow had had the
makings of a lawyer he could not have entered the profession
under happier auspices.&nbsp; The firm was an old established one
even in his day.&nbsp; It had been established in Tuck&rsquo;s
Court as Simpson and Rackham, then it became Rackham and Morse,
Rackham, Cooke and Rackham, and Rackham and Cooke; finally, Tom
Rackham, a famous Norwich man in his day, moved to another
office, and the firm of lawyers who at present occupy the
original offices is called Leathes Prior and Sons.&nbsp; Borrow
has told us frankly what a poor lawyer&rsquo;s clerk he
made&mdash;he was always thinking of things remote from that
profession, of gypsies, of prize-fighters, and of
word-makers.&nbsp; Yet he loved the head of the firm, William
Simpson, who must have been a kind and tolerant guide to the
curious youth.&nbsp; Simpson was for a time Town Clerk of
Norwich, and his portrait hangs in the Blackfriars Hall.&nbsp;
Borrow went to live with Mr. Simpson in the Upper Close near the
Grammar School.&nbsp; Archdeacon Groome recalled having seen
Borrow &ldquo;reserved and solitary&rdquo; haunting the precincts
of the playground; another schoolboy, William Drake, remembered
him as &ldquo;tall, spare, dark-complexioned.&rdquo; <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a></p>
<p>Borrow tells us how at this time he studied the Welsh language
and later the Danish; his master said that his inattention would
assuredly make him a bankrupt, and his father sighed over his
eccentric and impracticable son.&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>The passion for languages had indeed
caught hold of Borrow.&nbsp; Among my Borrow papers I find a
memorandum in the handwriting of his stepdaughter, in which she
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have often heard his mother say, that when a
mere child of eight or nine years, all his pocket-money was spent
in purchasing foreign Dictionaries and Grammars; he formed an
acquaintance with an old woman who kept a bookstall in the
market-place of Norwich, whose son went voyages to Holland with
cattle, and brought home Dutch books, which were eagerly bought
by little George.&nbsp; One day the old woman was crying, and
told him that her son was in prison.&nbsp; &ldquo;For doing
what?&rdquo; asked the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;For taking a silk
handkerchief out of a gentleman&rsquo;s pocket.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;your son stole the
pocket handkerchief?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No dear, no, my son did
not steal,&mdash;he only glyfaked.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have no difficulty in recognising here the heroine of the
Moll Flanders episode in <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; But it was not
from casual meetings with Welsh grooms and Danes and Dutchmen
that Borrow acquired even such command of various languages as
was undoubtedly his.&nbsp; We have it on the authority of an old
fellow-pupil at the Grammar School, Burcham, afterwards a London
police-magistrate, that William Taylor gave him lessons in
German, <a name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> but he acquired most of his varied
knowledge in these impressionable years in the Corporation
Library of Norwich.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp found, in his very laudable
examination of some of the books, Borrow&rsquo;s neat pencil
notes, the making of which was not laudable on the part of his
hero.&nbsp; One book here marked was on ancient Danish
literature, the author of which, Olaus Wormius, gave him the hint
for calling himself Olaus Borrow for a time&mdash;a signature
that we find in some of Borrow&rsquo;s published
translations.&nbsp; Borrow at this time had aspirations of a
literary kind, and Thomas Campbell accepted a translation of
Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Diver</i>, which was sighed &ldquo;O.
B.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were also translations from the German,
Dutch, Swedish, and Danish, in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>.&nbsp;
Clearly Borrow was becoming a formidable linguist, if not a very
exact master of words.&nbsp; Still he remained a vagabond, and
loved to wander over Mousehold Heath, to the gypsy encampment,
and to make friends with the Romany folk; he loved also to haunt
the horse fairs for which Norwich was so celebrated; and he was
not averse from the companionship of wilder spirits <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>who loved
pugilism, if we may trust <i>Lavengro</i>, and if we may assume,
as we justly may, that he many times cast youthful, sympathetic
eyes on John Thurtell in these years, the to-be murderer of
Weare, then actually living with his father in a house on the
Ipswich Road, Thurtell, the father, being in no mean position in
the city&mdash;an alderman, and a sheriff in 1815.&nbsp; Yes,
there was plenty to do and to see in Norwich, and Borrow&rsquo;s
memories of it were nearly always kindly.</p>
<p>At the very centre of Borrow&rsquo;s Norwich life was William
Taylor, concerning whom we have already written much.&nbsp; It
was a Jew named Mousha, a quack it appears, who pretended to know
German and Hebrew, and had but a smattering of either language,
who first introduced Borrow to Taylor, and there is a fine
dialogue between the two in <i>Lavengro</i>, of which this is the
closing fragment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo; said the young
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no!&nbsp; And, between ourselves, it is that which
induces me to doubt sometimes the truth of my opinions.&nbsp; My
life, upon the whole, I consider a failure; on which account, I
would not counsel you, or anyone, to follow my example too
closely.&nbsp; It is getting late, and you had better be going,
especially as your father, you say, is anxious about you.&nbsp;
But, as we may never meet again, I think there are three things
which I may safely venture to press upon you.&nbsp; The first is,
that the decencies and gentlenesses should never be lost sight
of, as the practice of the decencies and gentlenesses is at all
times compatible with independence of thought and action.&nbsp;
The second thing which I would wish to impress upon you is, that
there is always some eye upon us; and that it is impossible to
keep anything we do from the world, as it will assuredly be
divulged by somebody as soon as it is his interest to do
so.&nbsp; The third thing which I would wish to press upon
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the youth, eagerly bending
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&rdquo;&mdash;and here the elderly individual laid
down his pipe upon the table&mdash;&ldquo;that it will be as well
to go on improving yourself in German!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taylor it was who, when Borrow determined to try his fortunes
in London with those bundles of unsaleable manuscripts, gave him
introductions to Sir Richard Phillips and to Thomas
Campbell.&nbsp; It was in the agnostic spirit that he had learned
from Taylor that he wrote during this period to his one friend in
London, Roger Kerrison.&nbsp; Kerrison was grandson of Sir Roger
Kerrison, Mayor of Norwich in 1778, as his son Thomas was after
him in 1806.&nbsp; Roger was articled, <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>as was Borrow, to the firm of Simpson
and Rackham, while his brother Allday was in a drapery store in
Norwich, but with mind bent on commercial life in Mexico.&nbsp;
George was teaching him Spanish in these years as a preparation
for his great adventure.&nbsp; Roger had gone to London to
continue his professional experience.&nbsp; He finally became a
Norwich solicitor and died in 1882.&nbsp; Allday went to
Zacatecas, Mexico, and acquired riches.&nbsp; John Borrow
followed him there and met with an early death, as we have
seen.&nbsp; Borrow and Roger Kerrison were great friends at this
time; but when <i>Lavengro</i> was written they had ceased to be
this, and Roger is described merely as an
&ldquo;acquaintance&rdquo; who had found lodgings for him on his
first visit to London.&nbsp; As a matter of fact that trip to
London was made easy for Borrow by the opportunity given to him
of sharing lodgings with Roger Kerrison at Milman Street, Bedford
Row, where Borrow put in an appearance on 1st April, 1824, some
two months after the following letter was written:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Roger</span>,&mdash;I did not
imagine when we separated in the street, on the day of your
departure from Norwich, that we should not have met again: I had
intended to have come and seen you off, but happening to dine at
W. Barron&rsquo;s I got into discourse, and the hour slipt past
me unawares.</p>
<p>I have been again for the last fortnight laid up with that
detestable complaint which destroys my strength, impairs my
understanding, and will in all probability send me to the grave,
for I am now much worse than when you saw me last.&nbsp; But
<i>nil desperandum est</i>, if ever my health mends, and possibly
it may by the time my clerkship is expired, I intend to live in
London, write plays, poetry, etc., abuse religion and get myself
prosecuted, for I would not for an ocean of gold remain any
longer than I am forced in this dull and gloomy town.</p>
<p>I have no news to regale you with, for there is none abroad,
but I live in the expectation of shortly hearing from you, and
being informed of your plans and projects; fear not to be prolix,
for the slightest particular cannot fail of being interesting to
one who loves you far better than parent or relation, or even
than the God whom bigots would teach him to adore, and who
subscribes himself, Yours unalterably,</p>

<p>Borrow might improve his German&mdash;not sufficiently, as we
shall see in our next chapter&mdash;but he would certainly <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>never make a
lawyer.&nbsp; Long years afterwards, when, as an old man, he was
frequently in Norwich, he not seldom called at that office in
Tuck&rsquo;s Court, where five strange years of his life had been
spent.&nbsp; A clerk in Rackham&rsquo;s office in these later
years recalls him waiting for the principal as he in his youth
had watched others waiting. <a name="citation54"></a><a

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> lost his father on the 28th
February, 1824.&nbsp; He reached London on the 2nd April of the
same year, and this was the beginning of his many
wanderings.&nbsp; He was armed with introductions from William
Taylor, and with some translations in manuscript from Danish and
Welsh poetry.&nbsp; The principal introduction was to Sir Richard
Phillips, a person of some importance in his day, who has so far
received but inadequate treatment in our own.&nbsp; Phillips was
active in the cause of reform at a certain period in his life,
and would seem to have had many sterling qualities before he was
spoiled by success.&nbsp; He was born in the neighbourhood of
Leicester, and his father was &ldquo;in the farming line,&rdquo;
and wanted him to work on the farm, but he determined to seek his
fortune in London.&nbsp; After a short absence, during which he
clearly proved to himself that he was not at present qualified to
capture London, young Phillips returned to the farm.&nbsp; Borrow
refers to his patron&rsquo;s vegetarianism, and on this point we
have an amusing story from his own pen!&nbsp; He had been, when
previously on the farm, in the habit of attending to a favourite
heifer:</p>
<blockquote><p>During his sojournment in London this animal had
been killed; and on the very day of his return to his
father&rsquo;s house, he partook of part of his favourite at
dinner, without his being made acquainted with the circumstance
of its having been slaughtered during his absence.&nbsp; On
learning this, however, he experienced a sudden indisposition;
and declared that so great an effect had the idea of his having
eaten part of his slaughtered favourite upon him, that he would
never again taste animal food; a vow to which he has hitherto
firmly adhered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farming not being congenial, Phillips hired a small room in
Leicester, and opened a school for instruction in the three <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>R&rsquo;s, a
large blue flag on a pole being his &ldquo;sign&rdquo; or signal
to the inhabitants of Leicester, who seem to have sent their
children in considerable numbers to the young schoolmaster.&nbsp;
But little money was to be made out of schooling, and a year
later Phillips was, by the kindness of friends, started in a
small hosiery shop in Leicester.&nbsp; Throwing himself into
politics on the side of reform, Phillips now founded the
<i>Leicester Herald</i>, to which Dr. Priestley became a
contributor.&nbsp; The first number was issued gratis in May,
1792.&nbsp; His <i>Memoir</i> informs us that it was an article
in this newspaper that secured for its proprietor and editor
eighteen months&rsquo; imprisonment in Leicester gaol, but he was
really charged with selling Paine&rsquo;s <i>Rights of
Man</i>.&nbsp; The worthy knight had probably grown ashamed of
<i>The Rights of Man</i> in the intervening years, and hence the
reticence of the memoir.&nbsp; Phillips&rsquo;s gaoler was the
once famous Daniel Lambert, the notorious &ldquo;fat man&rdquo;
of his day.&nbsp; In gaol Phillips was visited by Lord Moira and
the Duke of Norfolk.&nbsp; It was this Lord Moira who said in the
House of Lords in 1797 that &ldquo;he had seen in Ireland the
most absurd, as well as the most disgusting tyranny that any
nation ever groaned under.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moira became
Governor-General of Bengal and Commander-in-Chief of the Army in
India.&nbsp; The Duke of Norfolk, a stanch Whig, distinguished
himself in 1798 by a famous toast at the Crown and Anchor Tavern,
Arundel Street, Strand:&mdash;&ldquo;Our sovereign&rsquo;s
health&mdash;the majesty of the people!&rdquo; which greatly
offended George III., who removed Norfolk from his
lord-lieutenancy.&nbsp; Phillips seems to have had a very lax
imprisonment, as he conducted the <i>Herald</i> from gaol,
contributing in particular a weekly letter.&nbsp; Soon after his
release he disposed of the <i>Herald</i>, or permitted it to
die.&nbsp; It was revived a few years later as an organ of
Toryism.&nbsp; He had started in gaol another journal, <i>The
Museum</i>, and he combined this with his hosiery business for
some time longer, when an opportune fire relieved him of an
apparently uncongenial burden, and with the insurance money in
his pocket he set out for London once more.&nbsp; Here he started
as a hosier in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, lodging meantime in
the house of a milliner, where he fell in love with one of the
apprentices, Miss Griffiths, &ldquo;a native of
Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; His affections were won, we are na&iuml;vely
informed in the <i>Memoir</i>, by the young woman&rsquo;s talent
in the preparation of a vegetable <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>pie.&nbsp; This is our first glimpse
of Lady Phillips&mdash;&ldquo;a quiet, respectable woman,&rdquo;
whom Borrow was to meet at dinner long years afterwards.&nbsp;
Inspired, it would seem, by the kindly exhortation of Dr.
Priestley, he now transformed his hosiery business in St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard into a &ldquo;literary repository,&rdquo;
and started a singularly successful career as a publisher.&nbsp;
There he produced his long-lived periodical, <i>The Monthly
Magazine</i>, which attained to so considerable a fame.</p>
<p>This, then, was the man to whom George Borrow presented
himself in 1824.&nbsp; Phillips was fifty-seven years of
age.&nbsp; He had made a moderate fortune and lost it, and was
now enjoying another perhaps less satisfying; it included the
profits of <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, repurchased after his
bankruptcy, and some rights in many school-books.&nbsp; But the
great publishing establishment in Bridge Street had long been
broken up.&nbsp; Borrow would have found Taylor&rsquo;s
introduction to Phillips quite useless had the worthy knight not
at the moment been keen on a new magazine and seen the importance
of a fresh &ldquo;hack&rdquo; to help to run it.&nbsp; Moreover,
had he not written a great book which only the Germans could
appreciate, <i>Twelve Essays on the Phenomena of
Nature</i>?&nbsp; Here, he thought, was the very man to produce
this book in a German dress.&nbsp; Taylor was a thorough German
scholar, and he had vouched for the excellent German of his pupil
and friend.&nbsp; Hence a certain cordiality which did not win
Borrow&rsquo;s regard, but was probably greater than many a young
man would receive to-day from a publisher-prince upon whom he
might call laden only with a bundle of translations from the
Danish and the Welsh.&nbsp; Here&mdash;in
<i>Lavengro</i>&mdash;is the interview between publisher and
poet, with the editor&rsquo;s factotum Bartlett, whom Borrow
calls Taggart, as witness:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Well, sir, what is your pleasure?&rdquo;
said the big man, in a rough tone, as I stood there, looking at
him wistfully&mdash;as well I might&mdash;for upon that man, at
the time of which I am speaking, my principal, I may say my only
hopes, rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my name is So-and-so, and I
am the bearer of a letter to you from Mr. So-and-so, an old
friend and correspondent of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countenance of the big man instantly lost the suspicious
and lowering expression which it had hitherto exhibited; he
strode forward and, seizing me by the hand, gave me a violent
squeeze.</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am rejoiced
to see you in London.&nbsp; I have been long anxious for the
pleasure&mdash;we are old friends, though we have never before
met.&nbsp; Taggart,&rdquo; said he to the man who sat at the
desk, &ldquo;this is our excellent correspondent, the friend and
pupil of our excellent correspondent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phillips explains that he has given up publishing, except
&ldquo;under the rose,&rdquo; had only <i>The Monthly
Magazine</i>, here <a name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a> called <i>The Magazine</i>, but
contemplated yet another monthly, <i>The Universal Review</i>,
here called <i>The Oxford</i>.&nbsp; He gave Borrow much the same
sound advice that a publisher would have given him
to-day&mdash;that poetry is not a marketable commodity, and that
if you want to succeed in prose you must, as a rule, write
trash&mdash;the most acceptable trash of that day being <i>The
Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, which has sold in hundreds of
thousands, and is still much prized by the Evangelical folk who
buy the publications of the Religious Tract Society.&nbsp;
Phillips, moreover, asked him to dine to meet his wife, his son,
and his son&rsquo;s wife, and we know what an amusing account of
that dinner Borrow gives in <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; Moreover, he
set Borrow upon his first piece of hack-work, the <i>Celebrated
Trials</i>, and gave him something to do upon <i>The Universal
Review</i> and also upon <i>The Monthly</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
Universal</i> lasted only for six numbers, dying in January,
1825.&nbsp; In that year appeared the six volumes of the
<i>Celebrated Trials</i>, of which we have something to say in
our next chapter.&nbsp; Borrow found Phillips most exacting,
always suggesting the names of new criminals, and leaving it to
the much sweated author to find the books from which to extract
the necessary material.&nbsp; Then came the final
catastrophe.&nbsp; Borrow could not translate Phillips&rsquo;s
great masterpiece, <i>Twelve Essays on the Proximate Causes</i>,
into German with any real effectiveness although the testimonial
of the enthusiastic Taylor had led Phillips to assume that he
could.&nbsp; Borrow, as we shall see, knew many languages, and
knew them well colloquially, but he was not a grammarian, and he
could not write accurately in any one of the numerous
tongues.&nbsp; His wonderful memory gave him the words, but not
always any thoroughness of construction.&nbsp; He could make a
good translation of a poem by Schiller, because he brought his
own poetic fancy to the venture, but he had no interest in
Phillips&rsquo;s philosophy, and so he doubtless made a very bad
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>translation, as German friends were soon able to assure
Phillips, who had at last to go to a German for a translation,
and the book appeared at Stuttgart in 1826.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
Phillips&rsquo;s new magazine, <i>The Universal Review</i>, went
on its course.&nbsp; It lasted only for a few numbers, as we have
said&mdash;from March, 1824, to January, 1825&mdash;and it was
entirely devoted to reviews, many of them written by Borrow, but
without any distinction calling for comment to-day.&nbsp; Dr.
Knapp thought that Gifford was the editor, with Phillips&rsquo;s
son and George Borrow assisting.&nbsp; Gifford translated
<i>Juvenal</i>, and it was for a long time assumed that Borrow
wished merely to disguise Gifford&rsquo;s identity when he
referred to his editor as the translator of
<i>Quintilian</i>.&nbsp; But Sir Leslie Stephen has pointed out
in <i>Literature</i> that John Carey (1756&ndash;1826), who
actually edited <i>Quintilian</i> in 1822, was Phillips&rsquo;s
editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the poetry which I reviewed,&rdquo;
Borrow tells us, &ldquo;appeared to be published at the expense
of the authors.&nbsp; All the publications which fell under my
notice I treated in a gentlemanly . . . manner&mdash;no
personalities, no vituperation, no shabby insinuations; decorum,
decorum was the order of the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; And one feels that
Borrow was not very much at home.&nbsp; But he went on with his
<i>Newgate Lives and Trials</i>, which, however, were to be
published with another imprint, although at the instance of
Phillips.&nbsp; By that time he and that worthy publisher had
parted company.&nbsp; Probably Phillips had set out for Brighton,
which was to be his home for the remainder of his life.</p>

60</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smcap">&ldquo;Faustus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Romantic
Ballads&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the early pages of
<i>Lavengro</i> Borrow tells us nearly all we are ever likely to
know of his sojourn in London in the years 1824 and 1825, during
which time he had those interviews with Sir Richard Phillips
which are recorded in our last chapter.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp, indeed,
prints a little note from him to his friend Kerrison, in which he
begs his friend to come to him as he believes he is dying.&nbsp;
Roger Kerrison, it would seem, had been so frightened by
Borrow&rsquo;s depression and threats of suicide that he had left
the lodgings at 16 Milman Street, Bedford Row, and removed
himself elsewhere, and so Borrow was left friendless to fight
what he called his &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; alone.&nbsp; The
depression was not unnatural.&nbsp; From his own vivid narrative
we learn of Borrow&rsquo;s bitter failure as an author.&nbsp; No
one wanted his translations from the Welsh and the Danish, and
Phillips clearly had no further use for him after he had compiled
his <i>Newgate Lives and Trials</i> (Borrow&rsquo;s name in
<i>Lavengro</i> for <i>Celebrated Trials</i>), and was doubtless
inclined to look upon him as an impostor for professing, with
William Taylor&rsquo;s sanction, a mastery of the German language
which had been demonstrated to be false with regard to his own
book.&nbsp; No &ldquo;spirited publisher&rdquo; had come forward
to give reality to his dream thus set down:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had still an idea that, provided I could
persuade any spirited publisher to give these translations to the
world, I should acquire both considerable fame and profit; not,
perhaps, a world-embracing fame such as Byron&rsquo;s; but a fame
not to be sneered at, which would last me a considerable time,
and would keep my heart from breaking;&mdash;profit, not equal to
that which Scott had made by his wondrous novels, but which would
prevent me from starving, and enable me to achieve some other
literary enterprise.&nbsp; I read and re-read my ballads, and the
more I read them the more I was convinced that the public, in the
event of their being published, would freely purchase, and hail
them with the merited applause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>He has
a tale to tell us in <i>Lavengro</i> of a certain <i>Life and
Adventures of Joseph Sell</i>, <i>the Great Traveller</i>, the
purchase of which from him by a publisher at the last moment
saved him from starvation and enabled him to take to the road,
there to meet the many adventures that have become immortal in
the pages of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp has encouraged the
idea that <i>Joseph Sell</i> was a real book, ignoring the fact
that the very title suggests doubts, and was probably meant to
suggest them.&nbsp; In Norfolk, as elsewhere, a
&ldquo;sell&rdquo; is a word in current slang used for an
imposture or a cheat, and doubtless Borrow meant to make merry
with the credulous.&nbsp; There was, we may be perfectly sure, no
<i>Joseph Sell</i>, and it is more reasonable to suppose that it
was the sale of his translation of Klinger&rsquo;s <i>Faustus</i>
that gave him the much needed money at this crisis.&nbsp; Dr.
Knapp pictures Borrow as carrying the manuscript of his
translation of <i>Faustus</i> with him to London.&nbsp; There is
not the slightest evidence of this.&nbsp; It may be reasonably
assumed that Borrow made the translation from Klinger&rsquo;s
novel during his sojourn in London.&nbsp; It is true the preface
is dated &ldquo;Norwich, April 1825,&rdquo; but Borrow did not
leave London until the end of May, 1825, that is to say, until
after he had negotiated with &ldquo;W. Simpkin and R.
Marshall,&rdquo; now the well-known firm of Simpkin and Marshall,
for the publication of the little volume.&nbsp; That firm,
unfortunately, has no record of the transaction.&nbsp; My
impression is that Borrow in his wandering after old volumes on
crime for his great compilation, <i>Celebrated Trials</i>, came
across the French translation of Klinger&rsquo;s novel published
at Amsterdam.&nbsp; From that translation he acknowledges that he
borrowed the plate which serves as frontispiece&mdash;a plate
entitled &ldquo;The Corporation Feast.&rdquo;&nbsp; It represents
the corporation of Frankfort at a banquet turned by the devil
into various animals.&nbsp; It has been erroneously assumed that
Borrow had had something to do with the designing of this plate,
and that he had introduced the corporation of Norwich in vivid
portraiture into the picture.&nbsp; Borrow does, indeed,
interpolate a reference to Norwich into his translation of a not
too complimentary character, for at that time he had no very
amiable feelings towards his native city.&nbsp; Of the
inhabitants of Frankfort he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>They found the people of the place modelled after
so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features,
that the devil <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the
inhabitants of an English town called Norwich, when dressed in
their Sunday&rsquo;s best. <a name="citation62"></a><a
href="#footnote62" class="citation">[62]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the original German version of 1791 we have the town of
Nuremberg thus satirised.&nbsp; But Borrow was not the first
translator to seize the opportunity of adapting the reference for
personal ends.&nbsp; In the French translation of 1798, published
at Amsterdam, and entitled <i>Les Aventures du Docteur Faust</i>,
the translator has substituted Auxerre for Nuremberg.&nbsp; What
makes me think that Borrow used only the French version in his
translation is the fact that in his preface he refers to the
engravings of that version, one of which he reproduced; whereas
the engravings are in the German version as well.</p>
<p>Friedrich Maximilian von Klinger (1752&ndash;1831), who was
responsible for Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;first book,&rdquo; was
responsible for much else of an epoch-making character.&nbsp; It
was he who by one of his many plays, <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, gave
a name to an important period of German literature.&nbsp; In 1780
von Klinger entered the service of Russia, and in 1790 married a
natural daughter of the Empress Catherine.&nbsp; Thus his novel,
<i>Faust&rsquo;s Leben</i>, <i>Thaten und H&ouml;llenfahrt</i>,
was actually first published at St. Petersburg in 1791.&nbsp;
This was seventeen years before Goethe published his first part
of <i>Faust</i>, a book which by its exquisite poetry was to
extinguish for all self-respecting Germans Klinger&rsquo;s turgid
prose.&nbsp; Borrow, like the translator of Rousseau&rsquo;s
<i>Confessions</i> and of many another classic, takes refuge more
than once in the asterisk.&nbsp; Klinger&rsquo;s <i>Faustus</i>,
with much that was bad and even bestial, has merits.&nbsp; The
devil throughout shows his victim a succession of examples of
&ldquo;man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow nowhere
mentions Klinger&rsquo;s name in his book, of which the
title-page runs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Faustus: His Life, Death, and Descent into
Hell.&nbsp; Translated from the German.&nbsp; London: W. Simpkin
and R. Marshall, 1825.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I doubt very much if he really knew who was the author, as the
book in both the German editions I have seen as well as in the
French version bears no author&rsquo;s name on its
title-page.&nbsp; A letter of Borrow&rsquo;s in the possession of
an American collector indicates that he was back in Norwich in
September, <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>1825, after, we may assume, three months&rsquo;
wandering among gypsies and tinkers.&nbsp; It is written from
Willow Lane, and is apparently to the publishers of
<i>Faustus</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As your bill will become payable in a few days, I
am willing to take thirty copies of <i>Faustus</i> instead of the
money.&nbsp; The book has been <i>burnt</i> in both the libraries
here, and, as it has been talked about, I may perhaps be able to
dispose of some in the course of a year or so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter clearly demonstrates that the guileless Simpkin
and the equally guileless Marshall had paid Borrow for the right
to publish <i>Faustus</i>, and even though part of the payment
was met by a bill, I think we may safely find in the transaction
whatever verity there may be in the <i>Joseph Sell</i>
episode.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me know how you sold your
manuscript,&rdquo; writes Borrow&rsquo;s brother to him so late
as the year 1829.&nbsp; And this was doubtless
<i>Faustus</i>.&nbsp; The action of the Norwich libraries in
burning the book would clearly have had the sympathy of one of
its few reviewers had he been informed of the circumstance.&nbsp;
It is thus that the <i>Literary Gazette</i> for 16th July, 1825,
refers to Borrow&rsquo;s little book:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is another work to which no respectable
publisher ought to have allowed his name to be put.&nbsp; The
political allusions and metaphysics, which may have made it
popular among a low class in Germany, do not sufficiently season
its lewd scenes and coarse descriptions for British
palates.&nbsp; We have occasionally publications for the
fireside&mdash;these are only fit for the fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow returned then to Norwich in the autumn of 1825 a
disappointed man so far as concerned the giving of his poetical
translations to the world, from which he had hoped so much.&nbsp;
No &ldquo;spirited publisher&rdquo; had been forthcoming,
although Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s researches have unearthed a
&ldquo;note&rdquo; in <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, which, after
the fashion of the anticipatory literary gossip of our day,
announced that Olaus Borrow was about to issue <i>Legends and
Popular Superstitions of the North</i>, &ldquo;in two elegant
volumes.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this never appeared.&nbsp; Quite a
number of Borrow&rsquo;s translations from divers languages had
appeared from time to time, beginning with a version of
Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diver&rdquo; in <i>The New Monthly
Magazine</i> for 1823, continuing with Stolberg&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ode to a Mountain Torrent&rdquo; in <i>The Monthly
Magazine</i>, and including the &ldquo;Deceived
Merman.&rdquo;&nbsp; These <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>he collected into book form and, not
to be deterred by the coldness of heartless London publishers,
issued them by subscription.&nbsp; Three copies of the slim
octavo book lie before me, with separate title-pages:</p>
<p>(1) Romantic Ballads, Translated from the Danish; and
Miscellaneous Pieces by George Borrow.&nbsp; Norwich: Printed and
Published by S. Wilkin, Upper Haymarket, 1826.</p>
<p>(2) Romantic Ballads, Translated from the Danish; and
Miscellaneous Pieces by George Borrow.&nbsp; London: Published by
John Taylor, Waterloo Place, Pall Mall, 1826.</p>
<p>(3) Romantic Ballads, Translated from the Danish; and
Miscellaneous Pieces, by George Borrow.&nbsp; London: Published
by Wightman and Cramp, 24 Paternoster Row, 1826.</p>
<p>The book contains an introduction in verse by Allan
Cunningham, whose acquaintance Borrow seems to have made in
London.&nbsp; It commences:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sing, sing, my friend, breathe life again<br />
Through Norway&rsquo;s song and Denmark&rsquo;s strain:<br />
On flowing Thames and Forth, in flood,<br />
Pour Haco&rsquo;s war-song, fierce and rude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cunningham had not himself climbed very far up the literary
ladder in 1825, although he was forty-one years of age.&nbsp; At
one time a stonemason in a Scots village, he had entered
Chantrey&rsquo;s studio, and was &ldquo;superintendent of the
works&rdquo; to that eminent sculptor at the time when Borrow
called upon him in London, and made an acquaintance which never
seems to have extended beyond this courtesy to the younger
man&rsquo;s <i>Danish Ballads</i>.&nbsp; The point of sympathy of
course was that in the year 1825 Cunningham had published <i>The
Songs of Scotland</i>, <i>Ancient and Modern</i>.</p>
<p>Five hundred copies of the <i>Romantic Ballads</i> were
printed in Norwich by S. Wilkin, about two hundred being
subscribed for, mainly in that city, the other three hundred
being dispatched to London&mdash;to Taylor, whose name appears on
the London title-page, although he seems to have passed on the
book very quickly to Wightman and Cramp, for what reason we are
not informed.&nbsp; Borrow tells us that the two hundred
subscriptions of half a guinea &ldquo;amply paid expenses,&rdquo;
but he must have been cruelly disappointed, as he was doomed to
be more than once in his career, by the lack of public
appreciation outside of Norwich.&nbsp; Yet there were many
reasons for this.&nbsp; If Scott had made the ballad popular, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>he had also
destroyed it for a century&mdash;perhaps for ever&mdash;by
substituting the novel as the favourite medium for the
storyteller.&nbsp; Great ballads we were to have in every decade
from that day to this, but never another &ldquo;best
seller&rdquo; like <i>Marmion</i> or <i>The Lady of the
Lake</i>.&nbsp; Our <i>popular</i> poets had to express
themselves in other ways.&nbsp; Then Borrow, although his verse
has been underrated by those who have not seen it at its best, or
who are incompetent to appraise poetry, was not very effective
here, notwithstanding that the stories in verse in <i>Romantic
Ballads</i> are all entirely interesting.&nbsp; This fact is most
in evidence in a case where a real poet, not of the greatest, has
told the same story.&nbsp; We owe a rendering of &ldquo;The
Deceived Merman&rdquo; to both George Borrow and Matthew Arnold,
but how widely different the treatment!&nbsp; The story is of a
merman who rose out of the water and enticed a mortal&mdash;fair
Agnes or Margaret&mdash;under the waves; she becomes his wife,
bears him children, and then asks to return to earth.&nbsp;
Arriving there she refuses to go back when the merman comes
disconsolately to the church-door for her.&nbsp; Here are a few
lines from the two versions, which demonstrate that here at least
Borrow was no poet and that Arnold was a very fine one:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center">GEORGE BORROW</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: center">MATTHEW ARNOLD</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p class="poetry">&ldquo;Now, Agnes, Agnes list to me,<br />
Thy babes are longing so after thee.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I cannot come yet, here must I stay<br />
Until the priest shall have said his say.&rdquo;<br />
And when the priest had said his say,<br />
She thought with her mother at home she&rsquo;d stay.<br />
&ldquo;O Agnes, Agnes, list to me,<br />
Thy babes are sorrowing after thee.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Let them sorrow and sorrow their fill,<br />
But back to them never return I will.&rdquo;</p>
</td>
<td><p class="poetry">We climbed on the graves, on the stones
worn with rains,<br />
And we gazed up the aisles through the small leaded panes.<br />
She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:<br />
&ldquo;Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!<br />
Dear heart,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we are long alone;<br />
The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.&rdquo;<br />
But, ah, she gave me never a look,<br />
For her eyes were sealed on the holy book!<br />
Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.<br />
Come away, children, call no more!<br />
Come away, come down, call no more!</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It says much for the literary proclivities of Norwich at this
period that Borrow should have had so kindly a reception <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>for his book
as the subscription list implies.&nbsp; At the end of each of
Wilkin&rsquo;s two hundred copies a &ldquo;list of
subscribers&rdquo; is given.&nbsp; It opens with the name of the
Bishop of Norwich, Dr. Bathurst; it includes the equally familiar
names of the Gurdons, Gurneys, Harveys, Rackhams, Hares (then as
now of Stow Hall), Woodhouses&mdash;all good Norfolk or Norwich
names that have come down to our time.&nbsp; Mayor Hawkes, who is
made famous in <i>Lavengro</i> by Haydon&rsquo;s portrait, is
there also.&nbsp; Among London names we find John Bowring,
Borrow&rsquo;s new friend, and later to be counted an enemy,
Thomas Campbell, Benjamin Haydon and John Timbs.&nbsp; But the
name that most strikes the eye is that of
&ldquo;Thurtell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three of the family are among the
subscribers including Mr. George Thurtell of Eaton, near Norwich,
brother of the murderer; there also is the name of John Thurtell,
executed for murder exactly a year before.&nbsp; This would seem
to imply that Borrow had been a long time collecting these names
and subscriptions, and doubtless before the all-too-famous crime
of the previous year he had made Thurtell promise to become a
subscriber, and, let us hope, had secured his half-guinea.&nbsp;
That may account, with so sensitive and impressionable a man as
our author, for the kindly place that Weare&rsquo;s unhappy
murderer always had in his memory.&nbsp; Borrow, in any case, was
now, for a few years, to become more than ever a vagabond.&nbsp;
Not a single further appeal did he make to an unsympathetic
literary public for a period of five years at least.</p>
<h2><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smcap">&ldquo;Celebrated Trials&rdquo; and John
Thurtell</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow&rsquo;s</span> first book was
<i>Faustus</i>, and his second was <i>Romantic Ballads</i>, the
one being published, as we have seen, in 1825, the other in
1826.&nbsp; This chronology has the appearance of ignoring the
<i>Celebrated Trials</i>, but then it is scarcely possible to
count <i>Celebrated Trials</i> <a name="citation67a"></a><a
href="#footnote67a" class="citation">[67a]</a> as one of
Borrow&rsquo;s books at all.&nbsp; It is largely a compilation,
exactly as the <i>Newgate Calendar</i> and Howell&rsquo;s
<i>State Trials</i> are compilations.&nbsp; In his preface to the
work Borrow tells us that he has differentiated the book from the
<i>Newgate Calendar</i> <a name="citation67b"></a><a
href="#footnote67b" class="citation">[67b]</a> and the <i>State
Trials</i> <a name="citation67c"></a><a href="#footnote67c"
class="citation">[67c]</a> by the fact that he had made
considerable compression.&nbsp; This was so, and in fact in many
cases he has used the blue pencil rather than the pen&mdash;at
least in the earlier volumes.&nbsp; But Borrow attempted
something much more comprehensive than the <i>Newgate
Calendar</i> and the <i>State Trials</i> in his book.&nbsp; In
the former work the trials range from 1700 to 1802; in the latter
from the trial of Becket in 1163 to the trial of Thistlewood in
1820.&nbsp; Both works are concerned solely with this
country.&nbsp; Borrow went all over Europe, and the trials of
Joan of Arc, Count Struensee, Major Andr&eacute;, Count
Cagliostro, Queen Marie Antoinette, the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien, and
Marshal Ney, are included in his volumes.&nbsp; Moreover, while
what may be called state trials are numerous, including many of
the cases in <i>Howell</i>, the greater number are of a domestic
nature, including nearly <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>all that are given in the <i>Newgate
Calendar</i>.&nbsp; In the first two volumes he has naturally
mainly state trials to record; the later volumes record sordid
everyday crimes, and here Borrow is more at home.&nbsp; His style
when he rewrites the trials is more vigorous, and his narrative
more interesting.&nbsp; It is to be hoped that the exigent
publisher, who he assures us made him buy the books for his
compilation out of the &pound;50 that he paid for it, was able to
present him with a set of the <i>State Trials</i>, if only in one
of the earlier and cheaper issues of the work than the one that
now has a place in every lawyer&rsquo;s library.</p>
<p>The third volume of <i>Celebrated Trials</i>, although it
opens with the trial of Algernon Sidney, is made up largely of
crime of the more ordinary type, and this sordid note continues
through the three final volumes.&nbsp; I have said that
<i>Faustus</i> is an allegory of &ldquo;man&rsquo;s inhumanity to
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is emphatically, in more realistic form,
the distinguishing feature of <i>Celebrated Trials</i>.&nbsp;
Amid these records of savagery, it is a positive relief to come
across such a trial as that of poor Joseph Baretti.&nbsp;
Baretti, it will be remembered, was brought to trial because,
when some roughs set upon him in the street, he drew a dagger,
which he usually carried &ldquo;to carve fruit and
sweetmeats,&rdquo; and killed his assailant.&nbsp; In that age,
when our law courts were a veritable shambles, how cheerful it is
to find that the jury returned a verdict of
&ldquo;self-defence.&rdquo;&nbsp; But then Sir Joshua Reynolds,
Edmund Burke, Dr. Johnson, and David Garrick gave evidence to
character, representing Baretti as &ldquo;a man of benevolence,
sobriety, modesty, and learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; This trial is an
oasis of mercy in a desert of drastic punishment.&nbsp; Borrow
carries on his &ldquo;trials&rdquo; to the very year before the
date of publication, and the last trial in the book is that of
&ldquo;Henry Fauntleroy, Esquire,&rdquo; for forgery.&nbsp;
Fauntleroy was a quite respectable banker of unimpeachable
character, to whom had fallen at a very early age the charge of a
banking business that was fundamentally unsound.&nbsp; It is
clear that he had honestly endeavoured to put things on a better
footing, that he lived simply, and had no gambling or other
vices.&nbsp; At a crisis, however, he forged a document, in other
words signed a transfer of stock which he had no right to do, the
&ldquo;subscribing witness&rdquo; to his power of attorney being
Robert Browning, a clerk in the Bank of England, and father of <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>the
distinguished poet.&nbsp; Well, Fauntleroy was sentenced to be
hanged&mdash;and he was duly hanged at Newgate on 30th October,
1824, only thirteen years before Queen Victoria came to the
throne!</p>
<p>Borrow has affirmed that from a study of the <i>Newgate
Calendar</i> and the compilation of his <i>Celebrated Trials</i>
he first learned to write genuine English, and it is a fact that
there are some remarkably dramatic effects in these volumes,
although one here withholds from Borrow the title of
&ldquo;author&rdquo; because so much is &ldquo;scissors and
paste,&rdquo; and the purple passages are only occasional.&nbsp;
All the same I am astonished that no one has thought it worth
while to make a volume of these dramatic episodes, which are
clearly the work of Borrow, and owe nothing to the innumerable
pamphlets and chap-books that he brought into use.&nbsp; Take
such an episode as that of Schening and Harlin, two young German
women, one of whom pretended to have murdered her infant in the
presence of the other because she madly supposed that this would
secure them bread&mdash;and they were starving.&nbsp; The trial,
the scene at the execution, the confession on the scaffold of the
misguided but innocent girl, the respite, and then the
execution&mdash;these make up as thrilling a narrative as is
contained in the pages of fiction.&nbsp; Assuredly Borrow did not
spare himself in that race round the bookstalls of London to find
the material which the grasping Sir Richard Phillips required
from him.&nbsp; He found, for example, Sir Herbert Croft&rsquo;s
volume, <i>Love and Madness</i>, the supposed correspondence of
Parson Hackman and Martha Reay, whom he murdered.&nbsp; That
correspondence is now known to be an invention of
Croft&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Borrow accepted it as genuine, and
incorporated the whole of it in his story of the Hackman
trial.</p>
<p>But after all, the trial which we read with greatest interest
in these volumes is that of John Thurtell, because Borrow had
known Thurtell in his youth, and gives us more than one glimpse
of him in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i>.</p>
<p>Rarely in our criminal jurisprudence has a murder trial
excited more interest than that of John Thurtell for the murder
of Weare&mdash;the Gill&rsquo;s Hill Murder, as it was
called.&nbsp; Certainly no murder of modern times has had so many
indirect literary associations.&nbsp; Borrow, Carlyle, Hazlitt,
Walter Scott, and Thackeray are among those who have given it <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>lasting fame
by comment of one kind or another; and the lines ascribed to
Theodore Hook are perhaps as well known as any other memory of
the tragedy:</p>
<blockquote><p>They cut his throat from ear to ear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His brain they battered in,<br />
His name was Mr. William Weare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He dwelt in Lyon&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carlyle&rsquo;s division of human beings of the upper classes
into &ldquo;noblemen, gentlemen, and gigmen,&rdquo; which occurs
in his essay on Richter, and a later reference to gigmanhood
which occurs in his essay on Goethe&rsquo;s Works, had their
inspiration in an episode in the trial of Thurtell, when the
question being asked, &ldquo;What sort of a person was Mr.
Weare?&rdquo; brought the answer, &ldquo;He was always a
respectable person.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by
respectable?&rdquo; the witness was asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;He kept a
gig,&rdquo; was the reply, which brought the word
&ldquo;gigmanity&rdquo; into our language. <a

<p>I have said that John Thurtell and two members of his family
became subscribers for Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Romantic Ballads</i>,
and it is certain that Borrow must often have met Thurtell, that
is to say looked at him from a distance, in some of the scenes of
prize-fighting which both affected, Borrow merely as a youthful
spectator, Thurtell as a reckless backer of one or other
combatant.&nbsp; Thurtell&rsquo;s father was an alderman of
Norwich living in a good house on the Ipswich Road when the
son&rsquo;s name rang through England as that of a
murderer.&nbsp; The father was born in 1765 and died in
1846.&nbsp; Four years after his son John was hanged he was
elected Mayor of Norwich, in recognition of his violent
ultra-Whig or blue and white political opinions.&nbsp; He had
been nominated as mayor both in 1818 and 1820, but it was perhaps
the extraordinary &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; of his son&rsquo;s
shameful death that gave the citizens of Norwich the necessary
enthusiasm to elect Alderman Thurtell as mayor in 1828.&nbsp; It
was in those oligarchical days a not unnatural fashion to be
against the Government.&nbsp; The feast at the Guildhall on this
occasion was attended by four hundred and sixty guests.&nbsp; A
year before John Thurtell was hanged, in 1823, his father moved a
violent political resolution in <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Norwich, but was out-Heroded by
Cobbett, who moved a much more extreme one over his head and
carried it by an immense majority.&nbsp; It was a brutal time,
and there cannot be a doubt that Alderman Thurtell, while busy
setting the world straight, failed to bring up his family very
well.&nbsp; John, as we shall see, was hanged; Thomas, another
brother, was associated with him in many disgraceful
transactions; while a third brother, George, also a subscriber,
by the way, to Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Romantic Ballads</i>, who was a
landscape gardener at Eaton, died in prison in 1848 under
sentence for theft.&nbsp; Apart from a rather riotous and bad
bringing up, which may be pleaded in extenuation, it is not
possible to waste much sympathy over John Thurtell.&nbsp; He had
thoroughly disgraced himself in Norwich before he removed to
London.&nbsp; There he got further and further into difficulties,
and one of the many publications which arose out of his trial and
execution was devoted to pointing the moral of the evils of
gambling.&nbsp; It was bad luck at cards, and the loss of much
money to William Weare, who seems to have been an exceedingly
vile person, that led to the murder.&nbsp; Thurtell had a friend
named Probert who lived in a quiet cottage in a byway of
Hertfordshire&mdash;Gill&rsquo;s Hill, near Elstree.&nbsp; He
suggested to Weare in a friendly way that they should go for a
day&rsquo;s shooting at Gill&rsquo;s Hill, and that Probert would
put them up for the night.&nbsp; Weare went home, collected a few
things in a bag, and took a hackney coach to a given spot, where
Thurtell met him with a gig.&nbsp; The two men drove out of
London together.&nbsp; The date was 24th October, 1823.&nbsp; On
the high-road they met and passed Probert and a companion named
Joseph Hunt, who had even been instructed by Thurtell to bring a
sack with him&mdash;this was actually used to carry away the
body&mdash;and must therefore have been privy to the intended
murder.&nbsp; By the time the second gig containing Probert and
Hunt arrived near Probert&rsquo;s cottage, Thurtell met it in the
roadway, according to their accounts, and told the two men that
he had done the deed; that he had killed Weare first by
ineffectively shooting him, then by dashing out his brains with
his pistol, and finally by cutting his throat.&nbsp; Thurtell
further told his friends, if their evidence was to be trusted,
that he had left the body behind a hedge.&nbsp; In the night the
three men placed the body in a sack and carried it to a pond near
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Probert&rsquo;s house and threw it in.&nbsp; The next
night they fished it out and threw it into another pond some
distance away.&nbsp; Thurtell meanwhile had divided the
spoil&mdash;some &pound;20, which he said was all that he had
obtained from Weare&rsquo;s body&mdash;with his companions.&nbsp;
Hunt, it may be mentioned, afterwards declared his conviction
that Thurtell, when he first committed the murder, had removed
his victim&rsquo;s principal treasure, notes to the value of
three or four hundred pounds.&nbsp; Suspicion was aroused, and
the hue and cry raised through the finding by a labourer of the
pistol in the hedge, and the discovery of a pool of blood on the
roadway.&nbsp; Probert promptly turned informer; Hunt also tried
to save himself by a rambling confession, and it was he who
revealed where the body was concealed, accompanying the officers
to the pond and pointing out the exact spot where the corpse
would be found.&nbsp; When recovered the body was taken to the
Artichoke inn at Elstree, and here the coroner&rsquo;s inquest
was held.&nbsp; Meanwhile Thurtell had been arrested in London
and taken down to Elstree to be present at the inquest.&nbsp; A
verdict of murder against all three miscreants was given by the
coroner&rsquo;s jury, and Weare&rsquo;s body was buried in
Elstree Churchyard.</p>
<p>In January, 1824, John Thurtell was brought to trial at
Hertford Assizes, and Hunt also.&nbsp; But first of all there
were some interesting proceedings in the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench, before the Chief Justice and two other judges, complaining
that Thurtell had not been allowed to see his counsel.&nbsp; And
there were other points at issue.&nbsp; Thurtell&rsquo;s counsel
moved for a criminal injunction against the proprietor of the
Surrey Theatre in that a performance had been held there, and was
being held, which assumed Thurtell&rsquo;s guilt, the identical
horse and gig being exhibited in which Weare was supposed to have
ridden to the scene of his death.&nbsp; Finally this was
arranged, and a <i>mandamus</i> was granted &ldquo;commanding the
admission of legal advisers to the prisoner.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last
the trial came on at Hertford before Mr. Justice Park.&nbsp; It
lasted two days, although the judge wished to go on all night in
order to finish in one.&nbsp; But the protest of Thurtell,
supported by the jury, led to an adjournment.&nbsp; Probert had
been set free and appeared as a witness.&nbsp; The jury gave a
verdict of guilty, and Thurtell and Hunt were sentenced to be
hanged, but Hunt escaped with transportation.&nbsp; <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Thurtell made
his own speech for the defence, which had a great effect upon the
jury, until the judge swept most of its sophistries away.&nbsp;
It was, however, a very able performance.&nbsp; Thurtell&rsquo;s
line of defence was to declare that Hunt and Probert were the
murderers, and that he was a victim of their perjuries.&nbsp; If
hanged, he would be hanged on circumstantial evidence only, and
he gave, with great elaboration, the details of a number of cases
where men had been wrongfully hanged upon circumstantial
evidence.&nbsp; His lawyers had apparently provided him with
books containing these examples from the past, and his month in
prison was devoted to this defence, which showed great
ability.&nbsp; The trial took place on 6th January, 1824, and
Thurtell was hanged on the 9th, in front of Hertford Gaol: his
body was given to the Anatomical Museum in London.&nbsp; A
contemporary report says that Thurtell, on the scaffold,</p>
<blockquote><p>fixed his eyes on a young gentleman in the crowd,
whom he had frequently seen as a spectator at the commencement of
the proceedings against him.&nbsp; Seeing that the individual was
affected by the circumstances, he removed them to another
quarter, and in so doing recognised an individual well known in
the sporting circles, to whom he made a slight bow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader of <i>Lavengro</i> might speculate whether that
&ldquo;young gentleman&rdquo; was Borrow, but Borrow was in
Norwich in January, 1824, his father dying in the following
month.&nbsp; In his <i>Celebrated Trials</i> Borrow tells the
story of the execution with wonderful vividness, and supplies
effective quotations from &ldquo;an eyewitness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow no doubt exaggerated his acquaintance with Thurtell, as in
his <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> romance he was fully entitled to do
for effect.&nbsp; He was too young at the time to have been much
noticed by a man so much his senior.&nbsp; The writer who accepts
Borrow&rsquo;s own statement that he really gave him &ldquo;some
lessons in the noble art&rdquo; is too credulous, and the
statement that Thurtell&rsquo;s house &ldquo;on the Ipswich Road
was a favourite rendezvous for the Fancy&rdquo; is unsupported by
evidence.&nbsp; Old Alderman Thurtell owned the house in
question, and we find no evidence that he encouraged his
son&rsquo;s predilection for prize-fighting.</p>
<h2><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smcap">Borrow and The Fancy</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">George Borrow</span> had no sympathy with
Thurtell the gambler.&nbsp; I find no evidence in his career of
any taste for games of hazard or indeed for games of any kind,
although we recall that as a mere child he was able to barter a
pack of cards for the Irish language.&nbsp; But he had certainly
very considerable sympathy with the notorious criminal as a
friend and patron of prize-fighting.&nbsp; This now discredited
pastime Borrow ever counted a virtue.&nbsp; Was not his
God-fearing father a champion in his way, or, at least, had he
not in open fight beaten the champion of the moment, Big Ben
Brain?&nbsp; Moreover, who was there in those days with blood in
his veins who did not count the cultivation of the Fancy as the
noblest and most manly of pursuits!&nbsp; Why, William Hazlitt, a
prince among English essayists, whose writings are a beloved
classic in our day, wrote in <i>The New Monthly Magazine</i> in
these very years his own eloquent impression, and even introduces
John Thurtell more than once as &ldquo;Tom Turtle,&rdquo; little
thinking then of the fate that was so soon to overtake him.&nbsp;
What could be more lyrical than this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reader, have you ever seen a fight?&nbsp; If not,
you have a pleasure to come, at least if it is a fight like that
between the Gas-man and Bill Neate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the best historian of prize-fighting, Henry Downes
Miles, the author of <i>Pugilistica</i>, has his own statement of
the case.&nbsp; You will find it in his monograph on John
Jackson, the pugilist who taught Lord Byron to box, and received
the immortality of an eulogistic footnote in <i>Don
Juan</i>.&nbsp; Here is Miles&rsquo;s defence:</p>
<blockquote><p>No small portion of the public has taken it for
granted that pugilism and blackguardism are synonymous.&nbsp; It
is as an antidote to these slanderers that we pen a candid
history of the boxers; and taking the general habits of men of
humble origin (elevated by their courage and bodily gifts to be
the associates of those more fortunate in worldly position), we
fearlessly maintain that <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the best of our boxers present as
good samples of honesty, generosity of spirit, goodness of heart
and humanity, as an equal number of men of any class of
society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Samuel Johnson onwards literary England has had a
kindness for the pugilist, although the magistrate has long, and
rightly, ruled him out as impossible.&nbsp; Borrow carried his
enthusiasm further than any, and no account of him that
concentrates attention upon his accomplishment as a distributor
of Bibles and ignores his delight in fisticuffs, has any grasp of
the real George Borrow.&nbsp; Indeed it may be said, and will be
shown in the course of our story, that Borrow entered upon Bible
distribution in the spirit of a pugilist rather than that of an
evangelist.&nbsp; But to return to Borrow&rsquo;s pugilistic
experiences.&nbsp; He claims, as we have seen, occasionally to
have put on the gloves with John Thurtell.&nbsp; He describes
vividly enough his own conflicts with the Flaming Tinman and with
Petulengro.&nbsp; His one heroine, Isopel Berners, had
&ldquo;Fair Play and Long Melford&rdquo; as her ideal,
&ldquo;Long Melford&rdquo; being the good right-handed blow with
which Lavengro conquered the Tinman.&nbsp; Isopel, we remember,
had learned in Long Melford Union to &ldquo;Fear God and take
your own part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Borrow, indeed, was at home with the whole army of
prize-fighters, who came down to us like the Roman Caesars or the
Kings of England in a noteworthy procession, their dynasty
commencing with James Fig of Thame, who began to reign in 1719,
and closing with Tom King, who beat Heenan in 1863, or with Jem
Mace, who flourished in a measure until 1872.&nbsp; With what
zest must Borrow have followed the account of the greatest battle
of all, that between Heenan and Tom Sayers at Farnborough in
1860, when it was said that Parliament had been emptied to
patronise a prize-fight; and this although Heenan complained that
he had been chased out of eight counties.&nbsp; For by this time,
in spite of lordly patronage, pugilism was doomed, and the more
harmless boxing had taken its place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pity that
corruption should have crept in amongst them,&rdquo; sighed
Lavengro in a memorable passage, in which he also has his paean
of praise for the bruisers of England:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let no one sneer at the bruisers of
England&mdash;what were the gladiators of Rome, or the
bull-fighters of Spain, in its palmiest days, compared to
England&rsquo;s bruisers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Yes:
Borrow was never hard on the bruisers of England, and followed
their achievements, it may be said, from his cradle to his
grave.&nbsp; His beloved father had brought him up, so to speak,
upon memories of one who was champion before George was
born&mdash;Big Ben Brain of Bristol.&nbsp; Brain, although always
called &ldquo;Big Ben,&rdquo; was only 5 feet 10 in. high.&nbsp;
He was for years a coal porter at a wharf off the Strand.&nbsp;
It was in 1791 that Ben Brain won the championship which placed
him upon a pinnacle in the minds of all robust people.&nbsp; The
Duke of Hamilton once backed him against the then champion, Tom
Johnson, for five hundred guineas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Public
expectation,&rdquo; says <i>The Oracle</i>, a contemporary
newspaper, &ldquo;never was raised so high by any pugilistic
contest; great bets were laid, and it is estimated &pound;20,000
was wagered on this occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben Brain was the
undisputed conqueror, we are told, in eighteen rounds, occupying
no more than twenty-one minutes.&nbsp; Brain died in 1794, and
all the biographers tell of the piety of his end, so that
Borrow&rsquo;s father may have read the Bible to him in his last
moments, as Borrow avers, but I very much doubt the accuracy of
the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Honour to Brain, who four months after the event
which I have now narrated was champion of England, having
conquered the heroic Johnson.&nbsp; Honour to Brain, who, at the
end of other four months, worn out by the dreadful blows which he
had received in his manly combats, expired in the arms of my
father, who read the Bible to him in his latter moments&mdash;Big
Ben Brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brain actually lived for four years after his fight with
Johnson, but perhaps the fight in Hyde Park between
Borrow&rsquo;s father and Ben, as narrated in <i>Lavengro</i>, is
all romancing.&nbsp; It makes good reading in any case, as does
Borrow&rsquo;s eulogy of some of his own contemporaries of the
prize-ring.</p>
<p>It is all very accurate history.&nbsp; We know that there
really was this wonderful gathering of the bruisers of England
assembled in the neighbourhood of Norwich in July, 1820, that is
to say, sixteen miles away at North Walsham.&nbsp; More than
25,000 men, it is estimated, gathered to see Edward Painter of
Norwich fight Tom Oliver of London for a purse of a hundred
guineas.&nbsp; There were three Belchers, heroes of the
prize-ring, but Borrow here refers to Tom, whose younger brother,
Jem, had died in 1811 at the age of thirty.&nbsp; Tom <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Belcher died
in 1854 at the age of seventy-one.&nbsp; Thomas Cribb was
champion of England from 1805 to 1820.&nbsp; One of Cribb&rsquo;s
greatest fights was with Jem Belcher in 1807, when, in the
forty-first and last round, as we are told by the chroniclers,
&ldquo;Cribb proving the stronger man put in two weak blows, when
Belcher, quite exhausted, fell upon the ropes and gave up the
combat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cribb had a prolonged career of glory, but
he died in poverty in 1848.&nbsp; Happier was an earlier
champion, John Gully, who held the glorious honour for three
years&mdash;from 1805 to 1808.&nbsp; Gully turned tavern-keeper,
and making a fortune out of sundry speculations, entered
Parliament as member for Pontefract, and lived to be eighty years
of age.</p>
<p>It is necessary to dwell upon Borrow as the friend of
prize-fighters, because no one understands Borrow who does not
realise that his real interests were not in literature but in
action.&nbsp; He would have liked to join the army but could not
obtain a commission.&nbsp; And so he had to be content with such
fighting as was possible.&nbsp; He cared more for the men who
could use their fists than for those who could but wield the
pen.&nbsp; He would, we may be sure, have rejoiced to know that
many more have visited the tomb of Tom Sayers in Highgate
Cemetery than have visited the tomb of George Eliot in the same
burial-ground.&nbsp; A curious moral obliquity this, you may
say.&nbsp; But to recognise it is to understand one side of
Borrow, and an interesting side withal.</p>

78</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smcap">Eight Years of Vagabondage</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> has been much nonsense
written concerning what has been called the &ldquo;veiled
period&rdquo; of George Borrow&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; This has
arisen from a letter which Richard Ford of the <i>Handbook for
Travellers in Spain</i> wrote to Borrow after a visit to him at
Oulton in 1844.&nbsp; Borrow was full of his projected
<i>Lavengro</i>, the idea of which he outlined to his
friends.&nbsp; He was a genial man in those days, on the wave of
a popular success.&nbsp; Was not <i>The Bible in Spain</i>
passing merrily from edition to edition!&nbsp; Borrow, it is
clear, told Ford that he was writing his
&ldquo;Autobiography&rdquo;&mdash;he had no misgiving then as to
what he should call it&mdash;and he evidently proposed to end it
in 1825 and not in 1833, when the Bible Society gave him his real
chance in life.&nbsp; His friend Ford indeed begged him not to
&ldquo;drop a curtain&rdquo; over the eight years succeeding
1825.&nbsp; &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; says Ford, &ldquo;it will
excite a mysterious interest,&rdquo; but then he adds in effect
it will lead to a wrong construction being put upon the
omission.&nbsp; Well, there can be but one interpretation, and
that not an unnatural one.&nbsp; Borrow had a very rough time
during these years.&nbsp; His vanity was hurt, and no
wonder.&nbsp; It seems a strange matter to us now that Charles
Dickens should have been ashamed of the blacking-bottle episode
of his boyhood.&nbsp; Genius has a right to a
poverty-stricken&mdash;even to a sordid, boyhood.&nbsp; But
genius has no right to a sordid manhood, and here was George
&ldquo;Olaus&rdquo; Borrow, who was able to claim the friendship
of William Taylor, the German scholar; who was able to boast of
his association with sound scholastic foundations, with the High
School at Edinburgh and the Grammar School at Norwich; who was a
great linguist and had made rare translations from the poetry of
many nations, starving in the byways of England and of
France.&nbsp; What a fate for such a man that he should have been
so unhappy for eight years; should have led the most penurious of
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>roving
lives, and almost certainly have been in prison as a common
tramp. <a name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a>&nbsp; It was all very well to romance
about a poverty-stricken youth.&nbsp; But when youth had fled
there ceased to be romance, and only sordidness was
forthcoming.&nbsp; From his twenty-third to his thirty-first year
George Borrow was engaged in a hopeless quest for the means of
making a living.&nbsp; There is, however, very little
mystery.&nbsp; Many incidents of each of these years are revealed
at one or other point.&nbsp; His home, to which he returned from
time to time, was with his mother at the cottage in Willow Lane,
Norwich.&nbsp; Whether he made sufficient profit out of a horse,
as in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, to enable him to travel upon the
proceeds, as Dr. Knapp thinks, we cannot say.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp is
doubtless right in assuming that during this period he led
&ldquo;a life of roving adventure,&rdquo; his own authorised
version of his career at the time, as we may learn from the
biography in his handwriting from <i>Men of the Time</i>.&nbsp;
But how far this roving was confined to England, how far it
extended to other lands, we do not know.&nbsp; We are, however,
satisfied that he starved through it all, that he rarely had a
penny in his pocket.&nbsp; At a later date he gave it to be
understood at times that he had visited the East, and that India
had revealed her glories to him.&nbsp; We do not believe
it.&nbsp; Defoe was Borrow&rsquo;s master in literature, and he
shared Defoe&rsquo;s right to lie magnificently on
occasion.&nbsp; Borrow certainly did some travel in these years,
but it was sordid, lacking in all dignity&mdash;never afterwards
to be recalled.&nbsp; For the most part, however, he was in
England.&nbsp; We know that Borrow was in Norwich in 1826, for we
have seen him superintending the publication of the <i>Romantic
Ballads</i> by subscription in that year.&nbsp; In that year also
he wrote the letter to Haydon, the painter, to say that he was
ready to sit for him, but that he was &ldquo;going to the south
of France in a little better than a fortnight.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
know also that he was in Norwich in 1827, because it was then,
and not in 1818 as described in <i>Lavengro</i>, that he
&ldquo;doffed his hat&rdquo; to the famous trotting stallion
Marshland Shales, when that famous old horse was exhibited at
Tombland Fair on the Castle Hill.&nbsp; We meet him next as the
friend of Dr. Bowring.&nbsp; The letters to Bowring we must leave
to another chapter, but they commence in 1829 <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and continue
through 1830 and 1831.&nbsp; Through them all Borrow shows
himself alive to the necessity of obtaining an appointment of
some kind, and meanwhile he is hard at work upon his translations
from various languages, which, in conjunction with Dr. Bowring,
he is to issue as <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i>.&nbsp; It has been
said that in 1829 he made the translation of the <i>Memoirs of
Vidocq</i>, which appeared in that year with a short preface by
the translator. <a name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a"
class="citation">[80a]</a>&nbsp; But these little volumes bear no
internal evidence of Borrow&rsquo;s style, and there is no
external evidence to support the assumption that he had a hand in
their publication.&nbsp; His occasional references to Vidocq are
probably due to the fact that he had read this little book.</p>
<p>I have before me one very lengthy manuscript of Borrow&rsquo;s
of this period.&nbsp; It is dated December, 1829, and is
addressed, &ldquo;To the Committee of the Honourable and
Praiseworthy Association, known by the name of the Highland
Society.&rdquo; <a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a>&nbsp; It is a proposal that they
should publish in two thick octavo volumes a series of
translations of the best and most approved poetry of the ancient
and modern Scots-Gaelic bards.&nbsp; Borrow was willing to give
two years to the project, for which he pleads &ldquo;with no
sordid motive.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a dignified letter, which will
be found in one of Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s appendices&mdash;so
presumably Borrow made two copies of it.&nbsp; The offer was in
any case declined, and so Borrow passed from disappointment to
disappointment during these eight years, which no wonder he
desired, in the coming years of fame and prosperity, to veil as
much as possible.&nbsp; The lean years in the lives of any of us
are not those upon which we delight to dwell, or upon which we
most cheerfully look back. <a name="citation80c"></a><a

<h2><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smcap">Sir John Bowring</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Poor</span> George. . . . I wish he
were making money.&nbsp; He works hard and remains
poor&rdquo;&mdash;thus wrote John Borrow to his mother in 1830
from Mexico, and it disposes in a measure of any suggestion of
mystery with regard to five of those years that he wished to
veil.&nbsp; They were not spent, it is clear, in rambling in the
East, as he tried to persuade Colonel Napier many years
later.&nbsp; They were spent for the most part in diligent
attempt at the capture of words, in reading the poetry and the
prose of many lands, and in making translations of unequal merit
from these diverse tongues.&nbsp; This is indisputably brought
home to me by the manuscripts in my possession.&nbsp; These
manuscripts represent years of work.&nbsp; Borrow has been
counted a considerable linguist, and he had assuredly a reading
and speaking acquaintance with a great many languages.&nbsp; But
this knowledge was acquired, as all knowledge is, with infinite
trouble and patience.&nbsp; I have before me hundreds of small
sheets of paper upon which are written English words and their
equivalents in some twenty or thirty languages.&nbsp; These serve
to show that Borrow learnt a language as a small boy in an
old-fashioned system of education learns his Latin or
French&mdash;by writing down simple
words&mdash;&ldquo;father,&rdquo; &ldquo;mother,&rdquo;
&ldquo;horse,&rdquo; &ldquo;dog,&rdquo; and so on with the same
word in Latin or French in front of them.&nbsp; Of course Borrow
had a superb memory and abundant enthusiasm, and so was enabled
to add one language to another and to make his translations from
such books as he could obtain with varied success.&nbsp; I
believe that nearly all the books that he handled came from the
Norwich library, and when Mrs. Borrow wrote to her elder son to
say that George was working hard, as we may fairly assume, from
the reply quoted, that she did, she was recalling this laborious
work at translation that must have gone on for years.&nbsp; We
have seen <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>the first fruit in the translation from the
German&mdash;or possibly from the French&mdash;of Klinger&rsquo;s
<i>Faustus</i>; we have seen it in <i>Romantic Ballads</i> from
the Danish, the Irish, and the Swedish.&nbsp; Now there really
seemed a chance of a more prosperous utilisation of his gift, for
Borrow had found a zealous friend who was prepared to go forward
with him in his work of giving to the English public translations
from the literatures of the northern nations.&nbsp; This friend
was Dr. John Bowring, who made a very substantial reputation in
his day.</p>
<p>Bowring has told his own story in a volume of
<i>Autobiographical Recollections</i>, a singularly dull book for
a man whose career was at once so varied and so full of
interest.&nbsp; He was born at Exeter in 1792 of an old
Devonshire family, and entered a merchant&rsquo;s office in his
native city on leaving school.&nbsp; He early acquired a taste
for the study of languages, and learnt French from a refugee
priest precisely in the way in which Borrow had done.&nbsp; He
also acquired Italian, Spanish, German and Dutch, continuing with
a great variety of other languages.&nbsp; Indeed, only the very
year after Borrow had published <i>Faustus</i>, he published his
<i>Ancient Poetry and Romances of Spain</i>, and the year after
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Romantic Ballads</i> came Bowring&rsquo;s
<i>Servian Popular Poetry</i>.&nbsp; With such interest in common
it was natural that the two men should be brought together, but
Bowring had the qualities which enabled him to make a career for
himself, and Borrow had not.&nbsp; In 1811, as a clerk in a
London mercantile house, he was sent to Spain, and after this his
travels were varied.&nbsp; He was in Russia in 1820, and in 1822
was arrested at Calais and thrown into prison, being suspected by
the Bourbon Government of abetting the French Liberals.&nbsp;
Canning as Foreign Minister took up his cause, and he was
speedily released.&nbsp; He assisted Jeremy Bentham in founding
<i>The Westminster Review</i> in 1824.&nbsp; Meanwhile he was
seeking official employment, and in conjunction with Mr.
Villiers, afterwards Earl of Clarendon, and that ambassador to
Spain who befriended Borrow when he was in the Peninsula, became
a commissioner to investigate the commercial relations between
England and France.&nbsp; After the Reform Bill of 1832 Bowring
was frequently a candidate for Parliament, and was finally
elected for Bolton in 1841.&nbsp; In the meantime he assisted
Cobden in the formation of the Anti-Corn Law League in
1838.&nbsp; Having suffered great monetary losses in <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>the interval
he applied for the appointment of Consul at Canton, of which
place he afterwards became Governor, being knighted in
1854.&nbsp; At one period of his career at Hong Kong his conduct
was made the subject of a vote of censure in Parliament, Lord
Palmerston, however, warmly defending him.&nbsp; Finally
returning to England in 1862, he continued his literary work with
unfailing zest.&nbsp; He died at Exeter, in a house very near
that in which he was born, in 1872.&nbsp; His extraordinary
energies cannot be too much praised, and there is no doubt but
that in addition to being the possessor of great learning he was
a man of high character.&nbsp; His literary efforts were
surprisingly varied.&nbsp; There are at least thirty-six volumes
with his name on the title-page, most of them unreadable to-day;
even such works, for example, as his <i>Visit to the Philippine
Isles</i> and <i>Siam and the Siamese</i>, which involved travel
into then little-known lands.&nbsp; Perhaps the only book by him
that to-day commands attention is his translation of
Chamisso&rsquo;s <i>Peter Schlemihl</i>.&nbsp; The most readable
of many books by him into which I have dipped is his <i>Servian
Popular Poetry</i> of 1827, in which we find interesting stories
in verse that remind us of similar stories from the Danish in
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Romantic Ballads</i> published only the year
before.&nbsp; The extraordinary thing, indeed, is the many points
of likeness between Borrow and Bowring.&nbsp; Both were
remarkable linguists; both had spent some time in Spain and
Russia; both had found themselves in foreign prisons.&nbsp; They
were alike associated in some measure with Norwich&mdash;Bowring
through friendship with Taylor&mdash;and I might go on to many
other points of likeness or of contrast.&nbsp; It is natural,
therefore, that the penniless Borrow should have welcomed
acquaintance with the more prosperous scholar.&nbsp; Thus it is
that, some thirty years later, Borrow described the introduction
by Taylor:</p>
<blockquote><p>The writer had just entered into his eighteenth
year, when he met at the table of a certain Anglo-Germanist an
individual, apparently somewhat under thirty, of middle stature,
a thin and weaselly figure, a sallow complexion, a certain
obliquity of vision, and a large pair of spectacles.&nbsp; This
person, who had lately come from abroad, and had published a
volume of translations, had attracted some slight notice in the
literary world, and was looked upon as a kind of lion in a small
provincial capital.&nbsp; After dinner he argued a great deal,
spoke vehemently against the Church, and uttered the most
desperate Radicalism that was perhaps ever <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>heard,
saying, he hoped that in a short time there would not be a king
or queen in Europe, and inveighing bitterly against the English
aristocracy, and against the Duke of Wellington in particular,
whom he said, if he himself was ever president of an English
republic&mdash;an event which he seemed to think by no means
improbable&mdash;he would hang for certain infamous acts of
profligacy and bloodshed which he had perpetrated in Spain.&nbsp;
Being informed that the writer was something of a philologist, to
which character the individual in question laid great
pretensions, he came and sat down by him, and talked about
languages and literature.&nbsp; The writer, who was only a boy,
was a little frightened at first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quarrels of authors are frequently amusing but rarely
edifying, and this hatred of Bowring that possessed the soul of
poor Borrow in his later years is of the same texture as the
rest.&nbsp; We shall never know the facts, but the position is
comprehensible enough.&nbsp; Let us turn to the extant
correspondence which, as far as we know, opened when Borrow paid
what was probably his third visit to London in 1829:</p>

[<i>Dec.</i> 6, 1829.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Lest I should
intrude upon you when you are busy, I write to inquire when you
will be unoccupied.&nbsp; I wish to shew you my translation of
<i>The Death of Balder</i>, Ewald&rsquo;s most celebrated
production, which, if you approve of, you will perhaps render me
some assistance in bringing forth, for I don&rsquo;t know many
publishers.&nbsp; I think this will be a proper time to introduce
it to the British public, as your account of Danish literature
will doubtless cause a sensation.&nbsp; My friend Mr. R. Taylor
has my <i>K&aelig;mpe Viser</i>, which he has read and approves
of; but he is so very deeply occupied, that I am apprehensive he
neglects them: but I am unwilling to take them out of his hands,
lest I offend him.&nbsp; Your letting me know when I may call
will greatly oblige,&mdash;Dear Sir, your most obedient
servant,</p>

[<i>Dec.</i> 28, 1829.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I trouble you
with these lines for the purpose of submitting a little project
of mine for your approbation.&nbsp; When I had last the pleasure
of being at yours, you mentioned that we might at some future
period unite our strength in composing a kind of Danish
Anthology.&nbsp; You know, as well as I, that by far the most
remarkable portion of Danish poetry is comprised in those ancient
popular productions termed <i>K&aelig;mpe </i><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span><i>Viser</i>,
which I have translated.&nbsp; Suppose we bring forward at once
the first volume of the Danish Anthology, which should contain
the heroic and supernatural songs of the <i>K. V.</i>, which are
certainly the most interesting; they are quite ready for the
press with the necessary notes, and with an introduction which I
am not ashamed of.&nbsp; The second volume might consist of the
Historic songs and the ballads and Romances, this and the third
volume, which should consist of the modern Danish poetry, and
should commence with the celebrated &ldquo;Ode to the
Birds&rdquo; by Morten Borup, might appear in company at the
beginning of next season.&nbsp; To &Ouml;lenslager should be
allotted the principal part of the fourth volume; and it is my
opinion that amongst his minor pieces should be given a good
translation of his Aladdin, by which alone he has rendered his
claim to the title of a great poet indubitable.&nbsp; A proper
Danish Anthology cannot be contained in less than 4 volumes, the
literature being so copious.&nbsp; The first volume, as I said
before, might appear instanter, with no further trouble to
yourself than writing, if you should think fit, a page or two of
introductory matter.&mdash;Yours most truly, my dear Sir,</p>

<p>Borrow&rsquo;s next letter to Bowring that has been preserved
is dated 1835 and was written from Portugal.&nbsp; With that I
will deal when we come to Borrow&rsquo;s travels in the
Peninsula.&nbsp; Here it sufficeth to note that during the years
of Borrow&rsquo;s most urgent need he seems to have found a kind
friend if not a very zealous helper in the &ldquo;Old
Radical&rdquo; whom he came to hate so cordially.</p>
<h2><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smcap">Borrow and The Bible Society</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> George Borrow should have
become an agent for the Bible Society, then in the third decade
of its flourishing career, has naturally excited doubts as to his
moral honesty.&nbsp; The position was truly a contrast to an
earlier ideal contained in the letter to his Norwich friend,
Roger Kerrison, that we have already given, in which, with all
the zest of a Shelley, he declares that he intends to live in
London, &ldquo;write plays, poetry, etc., abuse religion, and get
myself prosecuted.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that was in 1824, and Borrow
had suffered great tribulation in the intervening eight
years.&nbsp; He had acquired many languages, wandered far and
written much, all too little of which had found a
publisher.&nbsp; There was plenty of time for his religious
outlook to have changed in the interval, and in any case Borrow
was no theologian.&nbsp; The negative outlook of &ldquo;Godless
Billy Taylor,&rdquo; and the positive outlook of certain
Evangelical friends with whom he was now on visiting terms, were
of small account compared with the imperative need of making a
living&mdash;and then there was the passionate longing of his
nature for a wider sphere&mdash;for travelling activity which
should not be dependent alone upon the vagabond&rsquo;s
crust.&nbsp; What matter if, as Harriet Martineau&mdash;most
generous and also most malicious of women, with much kinship with
Borrow in temperament&mdash;said, that his appearance before the
public as a devout agent of the Bible Society excited a
&ldquo;burst of laughter from all who remembered the old Norwich
days&rdquo;; what matter if another &ldquo;scribbling
woman,&rdquo; as Carlyle called such strident female writers as
were in vogue in mid-Victorian days&mdash;Frances Power
Cobbe&mdash;thought him &ldquo;insincere&rdquo;; these were
unable to comprehend the abnormal heart of Borrow, so entirely at
one with Goethe in <i>Wilhelm Meister&rsquo;s
Wanderjahre</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>Bleibe nicht am Boden heften,<br />
Frisch gewagt und frisch hinaus!<br />
Kopf und Arm, mit heitern Kr&auml;ften,<br />
Ueberall sind sie zu Haus;<br />
Wo wir uns der Sonne freuen,<br />
Sind wir jede Sorge los;<br />
Dass wir uns in ihr zerstreuen,<br />
Darum ist die Welt so gross. <a name="citation91a"></a><a
href="#footnote91a" class="citation">[91a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here was Borrow&rsquo;s opportunity indeed.&nbsp; Verily I
believe that it would have been the same had it been a society
for the propagation of the writings of Defoe among the
Persians.&nbsp; With what zest would Borrow have undertaken to
translate <i>Moll Flanders</i> and <i>Captain Singleton</i> into
the languages of Hafiz and Omar!&nbsp; But the Bible Society was
ready to his hand, and Borrow did nothing by halves.&nbsp; A good
hater and a staunch friend, he was loyal to the Bible Society in
no half-hearted way, and not the most pronounced quarrel with
forces obviously quite out of tune with his nature led to any
real slackening of that loyalty.&nbsp; In the end a portion of
his property went to swell the Bible Society&rsquo;s funds. <a
name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b"
class="citation">[91b]</a></p>
<p>When Borrow became one of its servants, the Bible Society was
only in its third decade.&nbsp; It was founded in the year 1804,
and had the names of William Wilberforce, Granville Sharp, and
Zachary Macaulay on its first committee.&nbsp; To circulate the
authorised version of the Bible without note or comment was the
first ideal that these worthy men set before them; never to the
entire satisfaction of the great printing organisations, which
already had a considerable financial interest in such a
circulation.&nbsp; For long years the words &ldquo;Sold under
cost price&rdquo; upon the Bibles of the Society excited mingled
feelings among those interested in the book trade.&nbsp; The
Society&rsquo;s first idea was limited to Bibles in the English
tongue.&nbsp; This was speedily modified.&nbsp; <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>A Bible
Society was set up in Nuremberg to which money was granted by the
parent organisation.&nbsp; A Bible in the Welsh language was
circulated broadcast through the Principality, and so the
movement grew.&nbsp; From the first it had one of its principal
centres in Norwich, where Joseph John Gurney&rsquo;s house was
open to its committee, and at its annual gatherings at Earlham
his sister Elizabeth Fry took a leading part, while Wilberforce,
Charles Simeon, the famous preacher, and Legh Richmond, whose
<i>Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter</i> Borrow failed to appreciate,
were of the company.&nbsp; &ldquo;Uncles Buxton and Cunningham
are here,&rdquo; we find one of Joseph John Gurney&rsquo;s
daughters writing in describing a Bible Society gathering.&nbsp;
This was John Cunningham, rector of Harrow, and it was his
brother who helped Borrow to his position in connection with the
Society, as we shall see.&nbsp; At the moment of these early
meetings Borrow is but a boy, meeting Joseph Gurney on the banks
of the river near Earlham, and listening to his discourse upon
angling.&nbsp; The work of the Bible Society in Russia may be
said to have commenced when one John Paterson of Glasgow, who had
been a missionary of the Congregational body, went to St.
Petersburg during those critical months of 1812 that Napoleon was
marching into Russia.&nbsp; Paterson indeed, William Canton tells
us, was &ldquo;one of the last to behold the old Tartar wall and
high brick towers&rdquo; and other splendours of the Moscow which
in a month or two were to be consumed by the flames.&nbsp;
Paterson was back again in St. Petersburg before the French were
at the gates of Moscow, and it is noteworthy that while Moscow
was burning, and the Czar was on his way to join his army, this
remarkable Scot was submitting to Prince Galitzin a plan for a
Bible Society in St. Petersburg, and a memorial to the Czar
thereon:</p>
<blockquote><p>The plan and memorial were examined by the Czar on
the 18th (of December); with a stroke of his pen he gave his
sanction&mdash;&ldquo;So be it, Alexander&rdquo;; and as he
wrote, the last tattered remnants of the Grand Army struggled
across the ice of the Niemen. <a name="citation92"></a><a
href="#footnote92" class="citation">[92]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Society was formed in January 1813, and when the Czar
returned to St. Petersburg in 1815, after the shattering of
Napoleon&rsquo;s power, he authorised a new translation of the <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Bible into
modern Russian.&nbsp; From Russia it was not a far cry, where the
spirit of evangelisation held sway, to Manchuria and to
China.&nbsp; To these remote lands the Bible Society desired to
send its literature.&nbsp; In 1822 the gospel of St. Matthew was
printed in St. Petersburg in Manchu.&nbsp; Ten years later the
type of the whole New Testament in that language was lying in the
Russian capital.&nbsp; &ldquo;All that was required was a Manchu
scholar to see the work through the press.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here came
the chance for Borrow.&nbsp; At this period there resided at
Oulton Hall, Suffolk, but a few miles from Norwich, a family of
the name of Skepper, Edmund and Anne his wife, with their two
children, Breame and Mary.&nbsp; Mary married in 1817 one Henry
Clarke, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy.&nbsp; He died afterwards
of consumption.&nbsp; A posthumous child of the marriage,
Henrietta Mary, was born two months after her father died.&nbsp;
Mary Clarke, as she now was, threw herself with zest into all the
religious enthusiasms of the locality, and the Rev. Francis
Cunningham, Vicar of St. Margaret&rsquo;s, Lowestoft, was one of
her friends.&nbsp; Borrow had met Mary Clarke on one of her
visits to Lowestoft, and she had doubtless been impressed with
his fine presence, to say nothing of the intelligence and varied
learning of the young man.&nbsp; The following note, the first
communication I can find from Borrow to his future wife,
indicates how matters stood at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;According to
promise I transmit you a piece of Oriental writing, namely the
tale of Blue Beard, translated into Turkish by myself.&nbsp; I
wish it were in my power to send you something more worthy of
your acceptance, but I hope you will not disdain the gift,
insignificant though it be.&nbsp; Desiring to be kindly
remembered to Mr. and Mrs. Skepper and the remainder of the
family,&mdash;I remain, dear Madam, your most obedient humble
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George

</blockquote>
<p>That Borrow owed his introduction to Mr. Cunningham to Mrs.
Clarke is clear, although Cunningham, in his letter to the Bible
Society urging the claims of Borrow, refers to the fact that a
&ldquo;young farmer&rdquo; in the neighbourhood had introduced
him.&nbsp; This was probably her brother, Breame <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>Skepper.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp was of the opinion that Joseph
John Gurney obtained Borrow his appointment, but the recently
published correspondence of Borrow with the Bible Society makes
it clear that Cunningham wrote&mdash;on 27th December,
1832&mdash;recommending Borrow to the secretary, the Rev. Andrew
Brandram.&nbsp; How little he knew of Borrow is indicated by the
fact that he referred to him as &ldquo;independent in
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brandram told Caroline Fox many years
afterwards that Gurney had effected the introduction, but this
was merely a lapse of memory.&nbsp; In fact we find Borrow asking
to be allowed to meet Gurney before his departure.&nbsp; In any
case he has himself told us, in one of the brief biographies of
himself that he wrote, that he promptly walked to London,
covering the whole distance of 112 miles in twenty-seven hours,
and that his expenses amounted to 5&frac12;d. laid out in a pint
of ale, a half-pint of milk, a roll of bread and two
apples.&nbsp; He reached London in the early morning, called at
the offices of the Bible Society in Earl Street, and was kindly
received by Andrew Brandram and Joseph Jowett, the two
secretaries.&nbsp; He was asked if he would care to learn Manchu,
and go to St. Petersburg.&nbsp; He was given six months for the
task, and doubtless also some money on account.&nbsp; He returned
to Norwich more luxuriously&mdash;by mail coach.&nbsp; In June,
1833, we find a letter from Borrow to Jowett, dated from Willow
Lane, Norwich, and commencing, &ldquo;I have mastered Manchu, and
I should feel obliged by your informing the committee of the
fact, and also my excellent friend, Mr. Brandram.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
long reply to this by Jowett is among my Borrow Papers, but the
Bible Society clearly kept copies of its letters, and a portion
of this one has been printed.&nbsp; It shows that Borrow went
through much heart-burning before his destiny was finally
settled.&nbsp; At last he was again invited to London, and found
himself as one of two candidates for the privilege of going to
Russia.&nbsp; The examination consisted of a Manchu hymn, of
which Borrow&rsquo;s version seems to have proved the more
acceptable, and he afterwards printed it in his
<i>Targum</i>.&nbsp; Finally, on the 5th of July, 1833, Borrow
received a letter from Jowett offering him the appointment with a
salary of &pound;200 a year and expenses.&nbsp; The letter
contained his first lesson in the then unaccustomed discipline of
the Evangelical vocabulary.&nbsp; He was not at first at home in
the precise measure <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>of unction required by his new friends.&nbsp; Borrow had
spoken of the prospect of becoming &ldquo;useful to the Deity, to
man, and to himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubtless you
meant,&rdquo; commented Jowett, &ldquo;the prospect of glorifying
God,&rdquo; and Jowett frankly tells him that his tone of
confidence in speaking of himself &ldquo;had alarmed some of the
excellent members of our committee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow adapted
himself at once, and is congratulated by Jowett in a later
communication upon the &ldquo;truly Christian&rdquo; spirit of
his next letter.</p>
<p>By an interesting coincidence there was living in Norwich at
the moment when Borrow was about to leave it, a man who had long
identified himself with good causes in Russia, and had lived in
that country for a considerable period of his life.&nbsp; John
Venning was born in Totnes in 1776, and he is buried&mdash;in the
Rosary Cemetery&mdash;at Norwich, where he died in 1858, after
twenty-eight years&rsquo; residence in that city.&nbsp; He
started for St. Petersburg four years after John Howard had died,
ostensibly on behalf of the commercial house with which he was
associated, but with the intention of carrying on the work of
that great man in prison reform.&nbsp; Alexander I. was on the
throne, and he made Venning his friend, frequently conversing
with him upon religious subjects.&nbsp; He became the treasurer
of a society for the humanising of Russian prisons; but when
Nicholas became Czar in 1825 Venning&rsquo;s work became more
difficult, though the Emperor was sympathetic.&nbsp; Venning
returned to England in 1830, and thus opportunely, in 1833, was
able to give his fellow-townsman letters of introduction to
Prince Galitzin and other Russian notables, so that Borrow was
able to set forth under the happiest auspices&mdash;with an
entire change of conditions from those eight years of
semi-starvation that he was now to leave behind him for
ever.&nbsp; Borrow left London for St. Petersburg on 31st July,
1833, not forgetting to pay his mother before he left the
&pound;17 he had had to borrow during his time of stress.&nbsp;
Always devoted to his mother, Borrow sent her sums of money at
intervals from the moment the power of earning came to him.&nbsp;
We shall never know, we can only surmise, something of the
self-sacrificing devotion of that mother during the years in
which Borrow had failed to find remunerative work.&nbsp; Wherever
he wandered there had always been a home in the Willow Lane
cottage.&nbsp; It is probable that much the greater <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>part of the
period of his eight years of penury was spent under her
roof.&nbsp; Yet we may be sure that the good mother never once
reproached her son.&nbsp; She had just that touch of idealism in
her character that made for faith and hope.&nbsp; In any case
never more was Borrow to suffer penury, or to be a burden on his
mother.&nbsp; Henceforth, to her dying day, she was to be his
devoted care.</p>

97</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smcap">St. Petersburg and John P.
Hasfeld</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> travelled by way of Hamburg
and L&uuml;beck to Travem&uuml;nde, whence he went by sea to St.
Petersburg, now called Petrograd, where he arrived on the
twentieth of August, 1833.&nbsp; He was back in London in
September, 1835, and thus it will be seen that he spent two years
in Russia.&nbsp; After the hard life he had led, everything was
now rose-coloured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Petersburg is the finest city in
the world,&rdquo; he wrote to Mr. Jowett; &ldquo;neither London
nor Paris nor any other European capital which I have visited has
sufficient pretensions to enter into comparison with it in
respect to beauty and grandeur.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the striking
thing about Borrow in these early years was his capacity for
making friends.&nbsp; He had not been a week in St. Petersburg
before he had gained the regard of one William Glen, who, in
1825, had been engaged by the Bible Society to translate the Old
Testament into Persian.&nbsp; The clever Scot, of whom Borrow was
informed by a competent judge that he was &ldquo;a Persian
scholar of the first water,&rdquo; was probably too heretical for
the Society, which recalled him, much to his chagrin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is a very learned man, but of very simple and
unassuming manners,&rdquo; wrote Borrow to Jowett.&nbsp; His
version of the <i>Psalms</i> appeared in 1830, and of
<i>Proverbs</i> in 1831.&nbsp; Thus he was going home in despair,
but seems to have had &ldquo;good talk&rdquo; on the way with
Borrow in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; In 1845 his complete Old
Testament in Persian appeared in Edinburgh.&nbsp; This William
Glen has been confused with another William Glen, a law student,
who taught Carlyle Greek, but they had nothing in common.&nbsp;
Borrow and Carlyle could not possibly have had friends in
common.&nbsp; Borrow was drawn towards this William Glen by his
enthusiasm for the Persian language.&nbsp; But Glen departed out
of his life very quickly.&nbsp; Hasfeld, who entered it about the
same time, was to stay longer.&nbsp; Hasfeld was a Dane, now
thirty-three years of age, <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>who, after a period in the Foreign
Office at Copenhagen, had come to St. Petersburg as an
interpreter to the Danish Legation, but made quite a good income
as a professor of European languages in cadet schools and
elsewhere.&nbsp; The English language and literature would seem
to have been his favourite topic.&nbsp; His friendship for Borrow
was a great factor in Borrow&rsquo;s life in Russia and
elsewhere.&nbsp; If Borrow&rsquo;s letters to Hasfeld should ever
come to light, they will prove the best that he wrote.&nbsp;
Hasfeld&rsquo;s letters to Borrow were preserved by him.&nbsp;
Three of them are in my possession.&nbsp; Others were secured by
Dr. Knapp, who made far too little use of them.&nbsp; They are
all written in Danish on foreign notepaper: flowery,
grandiloquent productions we may admit, but if we may judge a man
by his correspondents, we have a revelation of a more human
Borrow than the correspondence with the friends at Earl Street
reveals:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">St.
Petersburg</span>, 6/18 <i>November</i>, 1836.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Much water
has run through the Neva since I last wrote to you, my last
letter was dated 5/17th April; the last letter I received from
you was dated Madrid, 23rd May, and I now see with regret that it
is still unanswered; it is, however, a good thing that I have not
written as often to you as I have thought about you, for
otherwise you would have received a couple of letters daily,
because the sun never sets without you, my lean friend, entering
into my imagination.&nbsp; I received the Spanish letter a day or
two before I left for Stockholm, and it made the journey with me,
for it was in my mind to send you an epistle from Svea&rsquo;s
capital, but there were so many petty hindrances that I was
nearly forgetting myself, let alone correspondence.&nbsp; I lived
in Stockholm as if each day were to be my last, swam in
champagne, or rested in girls&rsquo; embraces.&nbsp; You
doubtless blush for me; you may do so, but don&rsquo;t think that
that conviction will murder my almost shameless candour, the only
virtue which I possess, in a superfluous degree.&nbsp; In Sweden
I tried to be lovable, and succeeded, to the astonishment of
myself and everybody else.&nbsp; I reaped the reward on the most
beautiful lips, which only too often had to complain that the
fascinating Dane was faithless like the foam of the sea and the
ice of spring.&nbsp; Every wrinkle which seriousness had
impressed on my face vanished in joy and smiles; my frozen heart
melted and pulsed with the rapid beat of gladness; in short, I
was not recognisable.&nbsp; Now I have come back to my old
wrinkles, and make sacrifice again on the altar of friendship,
and when the incense, this letter, reaches you, then prove to me
your pleasure, wherever you may be, and let an echo of
friendship&rsquo;s voice resound from Granada&rsquo;s Alhambra or
Sahara&rsquo;s deserts.&nbsp; But I know that you, <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>good soul,
will write and give me great pleasure by informing me that you
are happy and well; when I get a letter from you my heart
rejoices, and I feel as if I were happy, and that is what
happiness consists of.&nbsp; Therefore let your soldierlike
letters march promptly to their place of
arms&mdash;paper&mdash;and move in close columns to St.
Petersburg, where they will find warm winter quarters.&nbsp; I
have received a letter from my correspondent in London, Mr.
Edward Thomas Allan, No. 11 North Audley St.; he informs me that
my manuscript has been promenading about, calling on publishers
without having been well received; some of them would not even
look at it, because it smelt of Russian leather; others kept it
for three or six weeks and sent it back with &ldquo;Thanks for
the loan.&rdquo;&nbsp; They probably used it to get rid of the
moth out of their old clothes.&nbsp; It first went to Longman and
Co.&rsquo;s, Paternoster Row; Bull of Hollis St.; Saunders and
Otley, Conduit St.; John Murray of Albemarle St., who kept it for
three weeks; and finally it went to Bentley of New Burlington
St., who kept it for SIX weeks and returned it; now it is to pay
a visit to a Mr. Colburn, and if he won&rsquo;t have the
abandoned child, I will myself care for it.&nbsp; If this finds
you in London, which is quite possible, see whether you can do
anything for me in this matter.&nbsp; Thank God, I shall not buy
bread with the shillings I perhaps may get for a work which has
cost me seventy nights, for I cannot work during the day.&nbsp;
In <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, No. 436, issued on the 3rd March
this year, you will find an article which I wrote, and in which
you are referred to; in the same paper you will also find an
extract from my translation.&nbsp; I hope that article will meet
with your approbation.&nbsp; Ivan Semionewitch sends his kind
regards to you.&nbsp; I dare not write any more, for then I
should make the letter a double one, and it may perhaps go after
you to the continent; if it reaches you in England, write AT ONCE
to your sincere friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">J. P.

<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">St.
Petersburg</span>, 9<i>th</i>/21<i>st</i> <i>July</i>, 1842.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I do not know
how I shall begin, for you have been a long time without any news
from me, and the fault is mine, for the last letter was from you;
as a matter of fact, I did produce a long letter for you last
year in September, but you did not get it, because it was too
long to send by post and I had no other opportunity, so that, as
I am almost tired of the letter, you shall, nevertheless, get it
one day, for perhaps you will find something interesting in it; I
cannot do so, for I never like to read over my own letters.&nbsp;
Six days ago I commenced my old hermit life; my sisters left me
on the 3rd/15th July, and are now, with God&rsquo;s help, in
Denmark.&nbsp; They left with the French steamer
<i>Amsterdam</i>, and had two Russian ladies with them, who are
to spend a few months with us and visit the sea
watering-places.&nbsp; These ladies are the Misses Koladkin, and
have learnt English from me, and became my sisters&rsquo; friends
as soon as they could <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>understand each other.&nbsp; My
sisters have also made such good progress in your language that
they would be able to arouse your astonishment.&nbsp; They read
and understand everything in English, and, thank you, very much
for the pleasure you gave them with your &ldquo;Targum&rdquo;;
they know how to appreciate &ldquo;King Christian stood by the
high mast,&rdquo; and everything which you have translated of
languages with which they are acquainted.&nbsp; They have not had
more than sixty real lessons in English.&nbsp; After they had
taken ten lessons, I began, to their great despair, to speak
English, and only gave them a Danish translation when it was
absolutely necessary.&nbsp; The result was that they became so
accustomed to English that it scarcely ever occurs to them to
speak Danish together; when one cannot get away from me one must
learn from me.&nbsp; The brothers and sisters remaining behind
are now also to go to school when they get home, for they have
recognised how pleasant it is to speak a language which servants
and those around one do not understand.&nbsp; During all the
winter my dearest thought was how, this summer, I was going to
visit my long, good friend, who was previously lean and who is
now fat, and how I should let him fatten me a little, so as to be
able to withstand better the long winter in Russia; I would then
in the autumn, like the bears, go into my winter lair fat and
sleek, and of all these romantic thoughts none has materialised,
but I have always had the joy of thinking them and of continuing
them; I can feel that I smile when such ideas run through my
mind.&nbsp; I am convinced that if I had nothing else to do than
to employ my mind with pleasant thoughts, I should become fat on
thoughts alone.&nbsp; The principal reason why this real pleasure
journey had to be postponed, was that my eldest sister, Hanna,
became ill about Easter, and it was not until the end of June
that she was well enough to travel.&nbsp; I will not speak about
the confusion which a sick lady can cause in a bachelor&rsquo;s
house, occasionally I almost lost my patience.&nbsp; For the
amount of roubles which that illness cost I could very well have
travelled to America and back again to St. Petersburg; I have,
however, the consolation in my reasonable trouble that the money
which the doctor and chemist have received was well spent.&nbsp;
The lady got about again after she had caused me and Augusta just
as much pain, if not more, than she herself suffered.&nbsp;
Perhaps you know how amiable people are when they suffer from
liver trouble; I hope you may never get it.&nbsp; I am not
anxious to have it either, for you may do what the devil you like
for such persons, and even then they are not satisfied.&nbsp; We
have had great festivals here by reason of the Emperor&rsquo;s
marriage; I did not move a step to see the pageantry; moreover,
it is difficult to find anything fresh in it which would afford
me enjoyment; I have seen illuminations and fireworks, the only
attractive thing there was must have been the King of Prussia;
but as I do not know that good man, I have not very great
interest in him either; nor, so I am told, did he ask for me, and
he went away without troubling himself in the slightest about me;
it was a good thing that I did not bother him.</p>

will be soon.&nbsp; What I shall do I do not yet know either, but

ill nearly all the winter, but now feel daily better, and when I
get on the water I shall soon be well.&nbsp; We have already had
hot and thundery weather, but it has now become cool again.&nbsp;
I have already sold the greater part of my furniture, and am
living in furnished apartments which cost me seventy roubles per
month; I shall soon be tired of that.&nbsp; I am expecting a
letter from Denmark which will settle matters, and then I can get
ready and spread my wings to get out into the world, for this is

102</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smcap">The Manchu
Bible&mdash;&ldquo;Targum&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
Talisman&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for the absurd object for which
Borrow was sent to Russia the less said the better.&nbsp; Any of
my readers who care for the survey of human folly associated with
undiscriminating Bible worship can read of this particular
example in the Society&rsquo;s own records. <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a>&nbsp; The Bible Society wanted the
Bible to be set up in the Manchu language, the official language
of the Chinese Court and Government.&nbsp; A Russian scholar
named Lip&oacute;ftsof, who had spent twenty years in China,
undertook in 1821 to translate the New Testament into Manchu for
&pound;560.&nbsp; Lip&oacute;ftsof had done his work in 1826, and
had sent two manuscript copies to London.&nbsp; In 1832 the Rev.
William Swan of the London Missionary Society in passing through
St. Petersburg discovered a transcript of a large part of the Old
and New Testament in Manchu, made by one Pierot, a French Jesuit,
many years before.&nbsp; This transcript was unavailable, but a
second was soon afterwards forthcoming for free publication if a
qualified Manchu scholar could be found to see it through the
Press.&nbsp; Mr. Swan&rsquo;s communication of these facts to the
Bible Society in London gave Borrow his opportunity.&nbsp; It was
his task to find the printers, buy the paper, and hire the
qualified compositors for setting the type.&nbsp; It must be
admitted Borrow worked hard for his &pound;200 a year.&nbsp;
First he had to ask the diplomatists for permission from the
Russian Government, not now so friendly to British missionary
zeal.&nbsp; The Russian Bible Society had been suppressed in
1826.&nbsp; He succeeded here.&nbsp; Then he had to continue his
studies in the Manchu language.&nbsp; He had written from Norwich
to Mr. Jowett on 9th June, 1833, &ldquo;I have mastered
Manchu,&rdquo; but on 20th January, 1834, we find him writing to
the <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>same
correspondent: &ldquo;I pay about six shillings, English, for
each lesson, which I grudge not, for the perfect acquirement of
Manchu is one of my most ardent wishes.&rdquo; <a
name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a>&nbsp; Then he found the
printers&mdash;a German firm, Schultz and Beneze&mdash;who
probably printed the two little books of Borrow&rsquo;s own for
him as a &ldquo;make weight.&rdquo;&nbsp; He purchased paper for
his Manchu translation with an ability that would have done
credit to a modern newspaper manager.&nbsp; Every detail of these
transactions is given in his letters to the Bible Society, and
one cannot but be amused at Borrow&rsquo;s explanation to the
Reverend Secretary of the little subterfuges by which he proposed
to &ldquo;best&rdquo; the godless for the benefit of the
godly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Knowing but too well that it is the general
opinion of the people of this country that Englishmen are made of
gold, and that it is only necessary to ask the most extravagant
price for any article in order to obtain it, I told no person, to
whom I applied, who I was, or of what country; and I believe I
was supposed to be a German. <a name="citation103b"></a><a
href="#footnote103b" class="citation">[103b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then came the composing or setting up of the type of the
book.&nbsp; When Borrow was called to account by his London
employers, who were not sure whether he was wasting time, he
replied: &ldquo;I have been working in the printing-office as a
common compositor, between ten and thirteen hours every
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another letter Borrow records further
difficulties with the printers after the composition had been
effected.&nbsp; Several of the working printers, it appears,
&ldquo;went away in disgust.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was resolved &ldquo;to do or die,&rdquo; and,
instead of distressing and perplexing the Committee with
complaints, to write nothing until I could write something
perfectly satisfactory, as I now can; and to bring about that
result I have spared neither myself nor my own money.&nbsp; I
have toiled in a close printing-office the whole day, during
ninety degrees of heat, for the purpose of setting an example,
and have bribed people to work whom nothing but bribes would
induce so to do.&nbsp; I am obliged to say all this in
self-justification.&nbsp; No member of the Bible Society would
ever have heard a syllable respecting what I have undergone but
for the question, &ldquo;What has Mr. Borrow been about?&rdquo;
<a name="citation103c"></a><a href="#footnote103c"
class="citation">[103c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>It is
not my intention to add materially to the letters of Borrow from
Russia and from Spain that have already been published, although
many are in my possession.&nbsp; They reveal an aspect of the
life of Borrow that has been amply dealt with already, and it is
an aspect that interests me but little.&nbsp; Here, however, is
one hitherto unpublished letter that throws much light upon
Borrow&rsquo;s work at this time, and shows, moreover, how well
he was learning the cant phrases which found acceptance with his
friends in Earl Street:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
the Rev. Andrew Brandram</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">St.
Petersburg</span>, 18<i>th</i> <i>Oct.</i>, 1833.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;Supposing that
you will not be displeased to hear how I am proceeding, I have
taken the liberty to send a few lines by a friend <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a> who is leaving Russia for
England.&nbsp; Since my arrival in Petersburg I have been
occupied eight hours every day in transcribing a Manchu
manuscript of the Old Testament belonging to Baron Schilling, and
I am happy to be able to say that I have just completed the last
of it, the Rev. Mr. Swan, the Scottish missionary, having before
my arrival copied the previous part.&nbsp; Mr. Swan departs to
his mission in Siberia in about two months, during most part of
which time I shall be engaged in collating our transcripts with
the original.&nbsp; It is a great blessing that the Bible Society
has now prepared the whole of the Sacred Scriptures in Manchu,
which will doubtless, when printed, prove of incalculable benefit
to tens of millions who have hitherto been ignorant of the will
of God, putting their trust in idols of wood and stone instead of
in a crucified Saviour.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that this country
in respect to religion is in a state almost as lamentable as the
darkest regions of the East, and the blame of this rests entirely
upon the Greek hierarchy, who discountenance all attempts to the
spiritual improvement of the people, who, poor things, are
exceedingly willing to receive instruction, and, notwithstanding
the scantiness of their means in general for the most part,
eagerly buy the tracts which a few pious English Christians cause
to be printed and hawked in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; But no one
is better aware, Sir, than yourself that without the Scriptures
men can never be brought to a true sense of their fallen and
miserable state, and of the proper means to be employed to free
themselves from the thraldom of Satan.&nbsp; The last few copies
which remained of the New Testament in Russian were purchased and
distributed a few days ago, and it is lamentable to be compelled
to state that at the present there appears no probability of
another edition being permitted in the modern language.&nbsp; It
is true that there are near twenty thousand copies of the
Sclavonic bible in the shop which is entrusted with the sale of
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the
books of the late Russian Bible Society, but the Sclavonian
translation is upwards of a thousand years old, having been made
in the eighth century, and differs from the dialect spoken at
present in Russia as much as the old Saxon does from the modern
English.&nbsp; Therefore it cannot be of the slightest utility to
any but the learned, that is, to about ten individuals in one
thousand.&nbsp; I hope and trust that the Almighty will see fit
to open some door for the illumination of this country, for it is
not to be wondered if vice and crime be very prevalent here when
the people are ignorant of the commandments of God.&nbsp; Is it
to be wondered that the people follow their every day pursuits on
the Sabbath when they know not the unlawfulness of so
doing?&nbsp; Is it to be wondered that they steal when only in
dread of the laws of the country, and are not deterred by the
voice of conscience which only exists in a few?&nbsp; This
accounts for their profanation of their Sabbath, their proneness
to theft, etc.&nbsp; It is only surprising that so much goodness
is to be found in their nature as is the case, for they are mild,
polite, and obliging, and in most of their faces is an expression
of great kindness and benignity.&nbsp; I find that the slight
knowledge which I possess of the Russian tongue is of the utmost
service to me here, for the common opinion in England that only
French and German are spoken by persons of any respectability in
Petersburg is a great and injurious error.&nbsp; The nobility, it
is true, for the most part speak French when necessity obliges
them, that is, when in company with foreigners who are ignorant
of Russian, but the affairs of most people who arrive in
Petersburg do not lie among the nobility, therefore a knowledge
of the language of the country, unless you associate solely with
your own countrymen, is indispensable.&nbsp; The servants speak
no language but their native tongue, and also nine out of ten of
the middle classes of Russians.&nbsp; I might as well address Mr.
Lip&oacute;ftsof, who is to be my coadjutor in the edition of the
New Testament (in Manchu), in Hebrew as in either French or
German, for though he can read the first a little he cannot speak
a word of it or understand when spoken.&nbsp; I will now conclude
by wishing you all possible happiness.&nbsp; I have the honour to
be, etc.,</p>

<p>When the work was done at so great a cost of money, and of
energy and enthusiasm on the part of George Borrow, it was found
that the books were useless.&nbsp; Most of these New Testaments
were afterwards sent out to China, and copies distributed by the
missionaries there as opportunities offered.&nbsp; It was found
then&mdash;why not before is not explained&mdash;that the Manchus
in China were able to read Chinese, preferring it to their own
language, which indeed had become almost confined to official
use. <a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a>&nbsp; In fact what was <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>a congenial
livelihood for Borrow&mdash;this production of a Bible in the
Manchu tongue&mdash;would have been death and desolation to the
highly placed caste of the Chinese Empire had these been
compelled to make use of Borrow&rsquo;s efforts.&nbsp; The
experiment was not to be made.&nbsp; The Bible Society had such
comfort for their subscribers as is contained in the fact that in
the year 1859 editions of <i>St. Matthew</i> and <i>St. Mark</i>
were published in Manchu and Chinese side by side, the Manchu
text being a reprint of that edited by Borrow, and that these
books are still in use in Chinese Turkestan.&nbsp; But Borrow had
here to suffer one of the many disappointments of his life.&nbsp;
If not actually a gypsy he had all a gypsy&rsquo;s love of
wandering.&nbsp; No impartial reader of the innumerable letters
of this period can possibly claim that there was in Borrow any of
the proselytising zeal or evangelical fervour which wins for the
names of Henry Martyn and of David Livingstone so much honour and
sympathy even among the least zealous.&nbsp; At the best
Borrow&rsquo;s zeal for religion was of the order of Dr. Keate,
the famous headmaster of Eton&mdash;&ldquo;Blessed are the pure
in heart . . . if you are not pure in heart, by God, I&rsquo;ll
flog you!&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow had got his New Testaments printed,
and he wanted to distribute them because he wished to see still
more of the world, and had no lack of courage to carry out any
well-defined scheme of the organisation which was employing
him.&nbsp; Borrow had thrown out constant hints in his letters
home.&nbsp; People had suggested to him, he said, that he was
printing Testaments for which he would never find readers.&nbsp;
If you wish for readers, they had said to him, &ldquo;you must
seek them among the natives of Pekin and the fierce hordes of
desert Tartary.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was this last most courageous
thing that Borrow proposed.&nbsp; Let him, he said to Mr. Jowett,
fix his headquarters at Kiachta upon the northern frontier of
China.&nbsp; The Society should have an agent there:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a person of few words, and will therefore
state without circumlocution that I am willing to become that
agent.&nbsp; I speak Russ, Manchu, and the Tartar or broken
Turkish of the Russian steppes, and have also some knowledge of
Chinese, which I might easily improve at Kiachta, half of the
inhabitants of which town are Chinamen.&nbsp; I am therefore not
altogether unqualified for such an adventure. <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>The
Bible Committee considered this and other plans through the
intervening months, and it seems clear that at the end they would
have sanctioned some form of missionary work for Borrow in the
Chinese Empire; but on 1st June, 1835, he wrote to say that the
Russian Government, solicitous of maintaining good relations with
China, would not grant him a passport across Siberia except on
the condition that he carried not one single Manchu Bible
thither. <a name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a>&nbsp; And so Borrow&rsquo;s dreams
were left unfulfilled.&nbsp; He was never to see China or the
farther East, although, because he was a dreamer and like his
hero, Defoe, a bit of a liar, he often said he had.&nbsp; In
September, 1835, he was back in England awaiting in his
mother&rsquo;s home in Norwich further commissions from his
friends of the Bible Society.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Work on the Manchu New Testament did not entirely absorb
Borrow&rsquo;s activities in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; He seems to
have made a proposition to another organisation, as the following
letter indicates.&nbsp; The proposal does not appear to have
borne any fruit:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Prayer Book and Homily Society</span>,<br />
No. 4 <span class="smcap">Exeter Hall</span>, <span
class="smcap">London</span>, <i>January</i> 16<i>th</i>,
1835.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letters dated July
and November 17, 1834, and addressed to the Rev. F. Cunningham,
have been laid before the Committee of the Prayer Book and Homily
Society, who have agreed to print the translation of the first
three Homilies into the Russian language at St. Petersburg, under
the direction of Mr. and Mrs. Biller, so soon as they shall have
caused the translation to undergo a thorough revision, and shall
have certified the same to this Society.&nbsp; I write by this
post to Mrs. Biller on the subject.&nbsp; In respect to the
second Homily in Manchu, if we rightly understand your statement,
an edition of five hundred copies may be sent forth, the whole
expense of which, including paper and printing, will amount to
about &pound;12.&nbsp; If we are correct in this the Committee
are willing to bear the expense of five hundred copies, by way of
trial, their wish being this, viz.: that printed copies should be
put into the hands of the most competent persons, who shall be
invited to offer such remarks on the translation as shall seem
desirable; especially that Dr. Morrison of Canton should be
requested to submit copies to the inspection of Manchu scholars
as he shall think fit.&nbsp; When the translation has been
thoroughly revised, the Committee will consider the propriety of
printing a larger edition.&nbsp; They think that the plan of
submitting copies in letters of gold to the <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>inspection
of the highest personages in China should probably be deferred
till the translation has been thus revised.&nbsp; We hope that
this resolution will be satisfactory to you; but the Committee,
not wishing to prescribe a narrower limit than such as is
strictly necessary, have directed me to say, that should the
expense of an edition of five hundred copies of the Homily in
Manchu exceed &pound;12, they will still be willing to meet it,
but not beyond the sum of &pound;15.</p>
<p>Should you print this edition be pleased to furnish us with
twenty-five copies, and send twenty-five copies at the least to
Rev. Dr. Morrison, at Canton, if you have the means of doing so;
if not, we should wish to receive fifty copies, that <i>we</i>
may send twenty-five to Canton.&nbsp; In this case you will be at
liberty to draw a bill upon us for the money, within the limits
specified above, in such manner as is most convenient.&nbsp;
Possibly Mr. and Mrs. Biller may be able to assist you in this
matter.&nbsp; Believe me, dear Sir, yours most sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">C. R.
Pritchett</span>.</p>
<p>Mr. G. Borrow.</p>
<p>I am not aware whether I am addressing a clergyman or a
layman, and therefore shall direct as above.&nbsp; Will you be so
kind as to send the MS. of the Russian Homilies to Mrs.
Biller?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During Borrow&rsquo;s last month or two in St. Petersburg he
printed two thin octavo volumes of translations&mdash;some of
them verses which, undeterred by the disheartening reception of
earlier efforts, he had continued to make from each language in
succession that he had the happiness to acquire, although most of
the poems are from his old portfolios.&nbsp; These little books
were named <i>Targum</i> and <i>The Talisman</i>.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp
calls the latter an appendix to the former.&nbsp; They are
absolutely separate volumes of verse.&nbsp; The publishers, it
will be seen, are the German firm that printed the Manchu New
Testament, Schultz and Beneze.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s preface to
<i>Targum</i> is dated &ldquo;St. Petersburg, June 1,
1835.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here in <i>Targum</i> we find the trial poem
which in competition with a rival candidate had won him the
privilege of going to Russia for the Bible Society&mdash;<i>The
Mountain Chase</i>.&nbsp; Here also among new verses are some
from the Arabic, the Persian, and the Turkish.&nbsp; If it be
true, as his friend Hasfeld said, that here was a poet who was
able to render another without robbing the garland of a single
leaf&mdash;that would but prove that the poetry which Borrow
rendered was not of the first order.&nbsp; Nor taking another
standard&mdash;the capacity to render <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the ballad with a force that
captures &ldquo;the common people&rdquo;&mdash;can we agree with
William Bodham Donne, who was delighted with <i>Targum</i> and
said that &ldquo;the language and rhythm are vastly superior to
Macaulay&rsquo;s <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
<i>The Talisman</i> we have four little poems from the Russian of
Pushkin followed by another poem, <i>The Mermaid</i>, by the same
author.&nbsp; Three other poems in Russian and Polish complete
the little book.&nbsp; Borrow left behind him in St. Petersburg
with his friend, Hasfeld, a presentation copy for Pushkin, who,
when he received it, expressed regret that he had not met his
translator while Borrow was in St. Petersburg.</p>

<span class="smcap">Three Visits to Spain</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> his journey to Russia Borrow
had acquired valuable experience, but nothing in the way of fame,
although his mother had been able to record in a letter to St.
Petersburg that she had heard at a Bible Society gathering in
Norwich his name &ldquo;sounded through the hall&rdquo; by Mr.
Joseph John Gurney and Mr. Cunningham, to her great
delight.&nbsp; &ldquo;All this is very pleasing to me,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo;&nbsp; Even more pleasing to
Borrow must have been a letter from Mary Clarke, his future wife,
who was able to tell him that she heard Francis Cunningham refer
to him as &ldquo;one of the most extraordinary and interesting
individuals of the present day.&rdquo;&nbsp; But these tributes
were not all-satisfying to an ambitious man, and this Borrow
undoubtedly was.&nbsp; His Russian journey was followed by five
weeks of idleness in Norwich varied by the one excitement of
attending a Bible meeting at Oulton with the Reverend Francis
Cunningham in the chair, when &ldquo;Mr. George Borrow from
Russia&rdquo; <a name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a> made one of the usual conventional
missionary speeches, Mary Clarke&rsquo;s brother, Breame Skepper,
being also among the orators.&nbsp; Borrow begged for more work
from the Society.&nbsp; He urged the desirability of carrying out
its own idea of an investigation in Portugal and perhaps also in
Spain, and hinted that he could write a small volume concerning
what he saw and heard which might cover the expense of the
expedition.&nbsp; So much persistency conquered.&nbsp; Borrow
sailed from London on 6th November, 1835, and reached Lisbon on
12th November, this his first visit to the Peninsula lasting
exactly eleven months.&nbsp; The next four years and six months
were to be spent mainly in <a name="page111"></a><span

divides itself in the following fashion:</p>

<p>What a world of adventure do the mere names of these places
call up.&nbsp; Borrow entered the Peninsula at an exciting period
of its history.&nbsp; Traces of the great war in which
Napoleon&rsquo;s legions faced those of Wellington still
abounded.&nbsp; Here and there a bridge had disappeared, and some
of Borrow&rsquo;s strange experiences on ferry-boats were
indirectly due to the results of Napoleon&rsquo;s ambition.&nbsp;
Everywhere there was still war in the land.&nbsp; Portugal indeed
had just passed through a revolution.&nbsp; The partisans of the
infant Queen Maria II. had been fighting with her uncle Dom
Miguel for eight years, and it was only a few short months before
Borrow landed at Lisbon that Maria had become undisputed
queen.&nbsp; Spain, to which Borrow speedily betook himself, was
even in a worse state.&nbsp; She was in the throes of a six
years&rsquo; war.&nbsp; Queen Isabel II., a child of three,
reigned over a chaotic country with her mother Dona Christina as
regent; her uncle Don Carlos was a formidable claimant to the
throne and had the support of the absolutist and clerical
parties.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s political sympathies were always in
the direction of absolutism; but in religion, although a staunch
Church of England man, he was certainly an anti-clerical one in
Roman Catholic Spain.&nbsp; In any case he steered judiciously
enough between contending factions, describing the fanatics of
either side with vigour and sometimes with humour.&nbsp; Mr.
Brandram&rsquo;s injunction to Borrow &ldquo;to be on his guard
against becoming too much committed to one particular
party&rdquo; seems to have been unnecessary.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s three expeditions to Spain have more to be said
for them than had his journey to St. Petersburg.&nbsp; The <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>work of the
Bible Society was and is at its highest point of human service
when distributing either the Old or the New Testament in
Christian countries, Spain, England, or another.&nbsp; Few there
be to-day in any country who, in the interests of civilisation,
would deny to the Bible a wider distribution.&nbsp; In a remote
village of Spain a Bible Society&rsquo;s colporteur, carrying a
coloured banner, sold me a copy of Cipriano de Valera&rsquo;s New
Testament for a peseta.&nbsp; But in the minds of the worthy
people who ran the Bible Society eighty years ago it was not so
much that humanity was to be bettered as that Roman Catholicism
was to be worsened.&nbsp; Every New Testament sold in Spain was
in the eyes of the English fanatic who subscribed his silver a
blow to the Church of that land.&nbsp; Otherwise and as to the
humanising influence of the propaganda it may be said that the
villages of Spain that Borrow visited could even at that time
compare favourably, morally and educationally, with villages of
his own county of Norfolk at the same period.&nbsp; The morals of
the agricultural labourers of the English fen country eighty
years ago were a scandal, and the peasantry read nothing; more
than half of them could not read.&nbsp; They had not, moreover,
the humanising passion for song and dance that Andalusia
knew.&nbsp; But this is not to deny that the Bible Society under
Borrow&rsquo;s instrumentality did a good work in Spain, nor that
they did it on the whole in a broad and generous way.&nbsp;
Borrow admits that there was a section of the Roman Catholic
clergy &ldquo;favourably disposed towards the circulation of the
Gospel,&rdquo; and the Society actually fixed upon a Roman
Catholic version of the Spanish Bible, that by Scio de San
Miguel, although this version Borrow considered a bad
translation.&nbsp; Much has been said about the aim of the Bible
Society to provide the Bible without notes or comment&mdash;in
its way a most meritorious aim, although then as now opposed to
the instinct of a large number of the priests of the Roman
Church.&nbsp; It is true that their attitude does not in any way
possess the sanction of the ecclesiastical authorities.&nbsp; It
may be urged, indeed, that the interpretation of the Bible by a
priest, usually of mature judgment, and frequently of a higher
education than the people with whom he is associated, is at least
as trustworthy as its interpretation at the hands of very
partially educated young women and exceedingly inadequately
equipped young <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>men who to-day provide interpretation and comment in so
many of the Sunday Schools of Protestant countries.</p>
<p>Behold George Borrow, then, first in Portugal and a little
later in Spain, upon his great mission&mdash;avowedly at first a
tentative mission&mdash;rather to see what were the prospects for
Bible distribution than to distribute Bibles.&nbsp; But
Borrow&rsquo;s zeal knew no such limitations.&nbsp; Before very
long he had a shop in one of the principal streets of
Madrid&mdash;the Calle del Principe&mdash;much more in the heart
of things than the very prosperous Bible Society of our day
ventures upon. <a name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a>&nbsp; Meanwhile he is at present in
Portugal not very certain of his movements, and he writes to his
old friend Dr. Bowring the following letter with a request with
which Bowring complied, although in the coldest manner:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Dr. John Bowring</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Evora in the
Alemtejo</span>, 27 <i>Decr.</i>, 1835.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Pray excuse me for
troubling you with these lines.&nbsp; I write to you, as usual,
for assistance in my projects, convinced that you will withhold
none which it may be in your power to afford, more especially
when by so doing you will perhaps be promoting the happiness of
our fellow creatures.&nbsp; I returned from dear, glorious Russia
about three months since, after having edited there the Manchu
New Testament in eight volumes.&nbsp; I am now in Portugal, for
the Society still do me the honour of employing me.&nbsp; For the
last six weeks I have been wandering amongst the wilds of the
Alemtejo and have introduced myself to its rustics, banditti,
etc., and become very popular amongst them, but as it is much
more easy to introduce oneself to the cottage than the hall
(though I am not entirely unknown in the latter), I want you to
give or procure me letters to the most liberal and influential
minds of Portugal.&nbsp; I likewise want a letter from the
Foreign Office to Lord De Walden, in a word, I want to make what
interest I can towards obtaining the admission of the Gospel of
Jesus into the public schools of Portugal which are about to be
<a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>established.&nbsp; I beg leave to state that this is
<i>my plan</i>, and not other persons&rsquo;, as I was merely
sent over to Portugal to observe the disposition of the people,
therefore I do not wish to be named as an Agent of the B.S., but
as a person who has plans for the mental improvement of the
Portuguese; should I receive <i>these letters</i> within the
space of six weeks it will be time enough, for before setting up
my machine in Portugal I wish to lay the foundation of something
similar in Spain.&nbsp; When you send the Portuguese letters
direct thus:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Mr. George Borrow,<br />
to the care of Mr. Wilby,<br />
Rua Dos Restauradores, Lisbon.</p>
<p>I start for Spain to-morrow, and I want letters something
similar (there is impudence for you) for Madrid, <i>which I
should like to have as soon as possible</i>.&nbsp; I do not much
care at present for an introduction to the Ambassador at Madrid,
as I shall not commence operations seriously in Spain until I
have disposed of Portugal.&nbsp; I will not apologise for writing
to you in this manner, for you know me, but I will tell you one
thing, which is that the letter which you procured for me, on my
going to St. Petersburg, from Lord Palmerston, assisted me
wonderfully.&nbsp; I called twice at your domicile on my return;
the first time you were in Scotland, the second in France, and I
assure you I cried with vexation.&nbsp; Remember me to Mrs.
Bowring and God bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">G.
Borrow</span>.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I am told that Mendiz&aacute;bal is liberal,
and has been in England; perhaps he would assist me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this eleven months&rsquo; stay in the Peninsula Borrow
made his way to Madrid, and here he interviewed the British
Minister, Sir George Villiers, afterwards fourth Earl of
Clarendon, and had received a quite remarkable encouragement from
him for the publication and distribution of the Bible.&nbsp; He
also interviewed the Spanish Prime Minister, Mendiz&aacute;bal,
&ldquo;whom it is as difficult to get nigh as it is to approach
the North Pole,&rdquo; and he has given us a picturesque account
of the interview in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; It was
agreed that 5,000 copies of the Spanish Testament were to be
reprinted from Scio&rsquo;s text at the expense of the Bible
Society, and all these Borrow was to handle as he thought
fit.&nbsp; Then Borrow made his way to Granada, where, under date
30th August, 1836, his autograph may be read in the
visitors&rsquo; book of the Alhambra:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>George Borrow
Norvicensis</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Here
he studied his friends the gypsies, now and probably then, as we
may assume from his <i>Zincali</i>, the sordid scum on the
hillside of that great city, but now more assuredly than then
unutterably demoralised by the numerous but curious tourists who
visit this rabble under police protection, the very policeman or
gendarme not despising a peseta for his protective
services.&nbsp; But Borrow&rsquo;s hobbies included the Romanies
of every land, and a year later he produced and published a gypsy
version of the Gospel of St. Luke.&nbsp; In October, 1836, Borrow
was back in England.&nbsp; He found that the Bible Society
approved of him.&nbsp; In November of the same year he left
London for Cadiz on his second visit to Spain.&nbsp; The journey
is described in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>; but here, from my
Borrow Papers, is a kind letter that Mr. Brandram wrote to
Borrow&rsquo;s mother on the occasion:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">No. 10 <span
class="smcap">East Street</span>, <i>Jany.</i> 11, 1837.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;I have the
joyful news to send you that your son has again safely arrived at
Madrid.&nbsp; His journey we were aware was exceedingly perilous,
more perilous than we should have allowed him to take had we
sooner known the extent of the danger.&nbsp; He begs me to write,
intending to write to you himself without delay.&nbsp; He has
suffered from the intense cold, but nothing beyond
inconvenience.&nbsp; Accept my congratulations, and my best
wishes that your dear son may be preserved to be your comfort in
declining years&mdash;and may the God of all consolation himself
deign to comfort your heart by the truths of that holy volume
your son is endeavouring, in connection with our Society, to
spread abroad.&mdash;Believe me, dear Madam, yours
faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">A.
Brandram</span>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borrow, Norwich.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A brilliant letter from Seville followed soon after, and then
he went on to Madrid, not without many adventures.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The cold nearly killed me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
swallowed nearly two bottles of brandy; it affected me no more
than warm water.&rdquo;&nbsp; This to kindly Mr. Brandram, who
clearly had no teetotaler proclivities, for the letter, as he
said, &ldquo;filled his heart with joy and gladness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Meanwhile those five thousand copies of the New Testament were
a-printing, Borrow superintending the work with the assistance of
a new friend, Dr. Usoz.&nbsp; &ldquo;As soon as the book is
printed and issued,&rdquo; he tells Mr. Brandram, &ldquo;I will
ride forth from Madrid into the wildest parts of Spain, . .
.&rdquo; and so, after some correspondence <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>with the
Society which is quite entertaining, he did.&nbsp; The reader of
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> will note some seventy separate towns
and villages that Borrow visited, not without countless
remarkable adventures on the way.&nbsp; &ldquo;I felt some
desire,&rdquo; he says in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, &ldquo;to meet
with one of those adventures which upon the roads of England are
generally as plentiful as blackberries in autumn.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Assuredly in this tour of Spanish villages Borrow met with no
lack of adventures.&nbsp; The committee of the Bible Society
authorised this tour in March, 1837, and in May Borrow started
off on horseback attended by his faithful servant, Antonio.&nbsp;
This tour was to last five months, and &ldquo;if I am
spared,&rdquo; he writes to his friend Hasfeld, &ldquo;and have
not fallen a prey to sickness, Carlists, banditti, or wild
beasts, I shall return to Madrid.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hopes a little
later, he tells Hasfeld, to be sent to China.&nbsp; We have then
a glimpse of his servant, the excellent Antonio, which
supplements that contained in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is inordinately given to drink, and is of so
quarrelsome a disposition that he is almost constantly involved
in some broil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not all his weird experiences were
conveyed in his letters to the Bible Society&rsquo;s
secretary.&nbsp; Some of these letters, however&mdash;the more
highly coloured ones&mdash;were used in <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, word for word, and wonderful reading they must have
made for the secretary, who indeed asked for more, although, with
a view to keeping Borrow humble&mdash;an impossible
task&mdash;Mr. Brandram takes occasion to say &ldquo;Mr.
Graydon&rsquo;s letters, as well as yours, are deeply
interesting,&rdquo; Graydon being a hated rival, as we shall
see.&nbsp; The question of money was also not overlooked by the
assiduous secretary.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know you are no
accountant,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;but do not forget there are
some who are,&rdquo; and a financial document was forwarded to
Borrow about this time as a stimulus and a warning.</p>
<p>But Borrow was happy, for next to the adventures of five
glorious months in the villages between Madrid and Coru&ntilde;a
nothing could be more to his taste than a good, wholesome
quarrel.&nbsp; He was imprisoned by order of the Spanish
Government and released on the intervention of the British
Embassy.&nbsp; He tells the story so graphically in <i>The Bible
in Spain</i> that it is superfluous to repeat it; but here he
does not tell of the great quarrel with regard <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>to
Lieutenant Graydon that led him to attack that worthy zealot in a
letter to the Bible Society.&nbsp; This attack did indeed cause
the Society to recall Graydon, whose zealous proclamation of
anti-Romanism must, however, have been more to the taste of some
of its subscribers than Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;trimming&rdquo;
methods.&nbsp; Moreover, Graydon worked for love of the cause and
required no salary, which must always have been in his
favour.&nbsp; Borrow was ten days in a Madrid prison, and there,
as ever, he had extraordinary adventures if we may believe his
own narrative, but they are much too good to be torn from their
context.&nbsp; Suffice to say here that in the actual
correspondence we find breezy controversy between Borrow and the
Society.&nbsp; Borrow thought that the secretary had called in
question the accuracy of his statements as to this or that
particular in his conduct.&nbsp; Ever a fighter, he appealed to
the British Embassy for confirmation of his word, and finally Mr.
Brandram suggested he should come back to England for a time and
talk matters over with the members of the committee.&nbsp; An
interesting letter to his future wife belongs to this period:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. Clarke</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Toledo</span>,
<i>Decr.</i> 5, 1837.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;I received
your letter the day previous to my leaving Madrid for this place,
whither I arrived in safety on the 2nd inst.&nbsp; I have availed
myself of the very first opportunity of answering it which has
presented itself.&nbsp; Permit me in the first place to
sympathise sincerely in the loss which you have, it appears,
lately sustained in your excellent brother, more especially as he
was my own good kind friend.&nbsp; I little deemed when I parted
from him only one short year since, at Oulton, that I was doomed
never to press his honest hand again; but why should we
grieve?&nbsp; He was a devout and humble Christian, and we have
no reason to doubt that he has been admitted to the joys of his
Lord; he was also zealous in his way, and although he had but two
talents entrusted to him, he turned them to the best account and
doubled them; perhaps he now rules over as many heavenly cities;
therefore why, why should we grieve?&nbsp; Indeed it is possible
that if we knew all, we should deem that we had high and cogent
reason to rejoice that the Lord has snatched him from earth and
earthly ties at this particular season.&nbsp; His principles were
very excellent, but an evil and undue influence, continually
exerted over him, might have gradually corrupted his heart, until
it became alienated from loyalty and true religion, which are
indeed inseparable; <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>for the latter he might have
substituted the vulgar savage bigotry of what is called
&ldquo;Dissent,&rdquo; for the former &ldquo;Radicalism,&rdquo;
that upas tree of the British Isles whose root is in the infernal
pit.</p>
<p>You have stated to me how unpleasantly you are situated, and
certain heavy trials which you have lately been subjected
to.&nbsp; You have, moreover, done me the honour to ask my advice
upon these points.&nbsp; I give it without hesitation and in a
very few words.&nbsp; Maintain unflinchingly your right, your
whole right, without yielding one particle, without abandoning
one position, as the slightest manifestation of weakness and
hesitation will be instantly taken advantage of by your
adversaries, and be fraught with danger to yourself.&nbsp; Permit
me here to state that it was in anticipation of something allied
to the evil spirit which has lately been displayed towards you, I
advised you on my last visit never to be persuaded to resign the
house which you now occupy; it is one of the strongest of your
entrenchments&mdash;abandon it and the foot of the enemy is in
your camp, and with the help of law and chicanery you might be
reduced to extremity.&nbsp; A line of the poet Spencer is
strongly applicable to your situation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Be firm, be firm, and
everywhere be firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would likewise strongly advise that with the least possible
delay you call in the entire amount of whatever claim you possess
on the landed property lately your brother&rsquo;s, else I
foresee that you will be involved in an endless series of dispute
and litigation, which by one single act of resolution you may
avoid.&nbsp; Remember that no forbearance on your part will be
properly appreciated, and that every kindly feeling and desire of
conciliation which you may display, will be set down to fear, and
the consciousness of standing on weak ground.&nbsp; I am old in
the knowledge of the world and those who dwell upon it, and would
rather trust myself to the loving mercies of the hungry wolves of
the Spanish mountains, than to the generosity and sense of
justice of the Radicals of England.&nbsp; However determined you
may show yourself, no reasonable person can cast any blame upon
you, for from the contents of your letter, it appears, that your
enemies have kept no terms with you, and entirely unprovoked,
have done all in their power to outrage and harrow your
feelings.&nbsp; Enough on this point.</p>
<p>Toledo was formerly the capital of Spain.&nbsp; Its population
at present barely amounts to fifteen thousand souls, though in
the time of the Romans and also during the Middle Ages, its
population is said to have amounted to between two and three
hundred thousand souls, which at present however does not amount
to fifteen thousand.&nbsp; It is situated about twelve leagues
(40 miles) to the westward of Madrid, and is built upon a steep
rocky hill, round which flows the Tagus on all sides but the
North.&nbsp; It still possesses a great many remarkable edifices,
notwithstanding that it has long since fallen into decay.&nbsp;
Its Cathedral is the most magnificent of Spain, and is the See of
<a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the
Primate.&nbsp; In the tower of this Cathedral is the famous bell
of Toledo, the largest in the world, with the exception of the
monster-bell of Moscow, which I have also seen.&nbsp; It weighs
1543 arrobes, or 37-032 pounds.&nbsp; It has, however, a
disagreeable sound, owing to a large cleft in its side.&nbsp;
Toledo could once boast the finest pictures in Spain, but many
were stolen or destroyed [by the] French during the Peninsular
War, and still more have lately been removed by order of the
Government.&nbsp; Perhaps the most remarkable still
remains.&nbsp; I allude to that which represents the burial of
the Count of Orgaz, the masterpiece of Domenico the Greek, a most
extraordinary genius some of whose productions possess merit of a
very high order; the picture in question is in the little parish
church of San Tom&eacute;, at the bottom of the aisle, at the
left hand of the altar.&nbsp; Could it be purchased, I should say
it would be cheap at &pound;5,000.&nbsp; You will easily guess
that I did not visit Toledo for the sake of seeing its
curiosities, but rather in the hope of propagating the
Word.&nbsp; I have this day caused three hundred advertisements
to be affixed to the walls, informing the people where it is to
be had.&nbsp; I have humble hope in the Lord that he will bless
my labours, notwithstanding that Toledo abounds with priests,
friars, and other minions of cruel Rome.&nbsp; Should you see my
dear Mrs. Ritson, pray remember me kindly to her and assure her
that I often think of her, and the same you may say to Miss
Henrietta.&nbsp; I hope my dear Mother is well.&nbsp; God bless
you at all times and seasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">G. B.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;My Gipsy Translation of Luke is ready for
the press, and I shall commence printing it as soon as I return
to Madrid.&nbsp; I hope that in the event of any of these
singular people visiting your neighbourhood you will seek them
out, and speak to them of Christ, and tell them what is being
done for their brethren in a far foreign land.&nbsp; A Gipsy
woman and her child have paid me several visits since my arrival
here; her husband is in the prison for mule-stealing, and next
week departs for ten years slavery in the galleys.&nbsp; She is
in great trouble and affliction, and says that I am the only
friend she has ever met with in Spain.&nbsp; She goes about
telling fortunes, in order to support her husband in prison,
notwithstanding that he had previously abandoned her, and
departed for Granada with another Gypsy woman of the name of
Aurora, who persuaded him to commit the robbery, for which he is
now suffering.&nbsp; If this is not conjugal affection, what
is?</p>

<p>In the beginning of September, 1838, Borrow was again <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>in England,
when he issued a lengthy and eloquent defence of his conduct and
a report on &ldquo;Past and Future Operations in
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; In December of the same year Borrow was again
on his way to Cadiz upon his third and last visit to Spain.</p>
<p>Borrow reached Cadiz on this his last visit on 31st December,
1838, and went straight to Seville, where he arrived on 2nd
January, 1839.&nbsp; Here he took a beautiful little house,
&ldquo;a paradise in its way,&rdquo; in the Plazuela de la Pila
Seca, and furnished it&mdash;clearly at the expense of his friend
Mrs. Clarke of Oulton, who must have sent him a cheque for the
purpose.&nbsp; He had been corresponding regularly with Mrs.
Clarke, who had told him of her difficulties with lawyers and
relatives, and Borrow had advised her to cut the Gordian knot and
come to Spain.&nbsp; But Mrs. Clarke and her daughter, Henrietta,
did not arrive from England until June.</p>
<p>In the intervening months Borrow had been working more in his
own interests than in those of the patient Bible Society, for he
started to gather material for his <i>Gypsies in Spain</i>, and
this book was for the most part actually written in
Seville.&nbsp; It was at this period that he had the many
interviews with Colonel Elers Napier that we quote at length in
our next chapter.</p>
<p>A little later he is telling Mr. Brandram of his adventure
with the blind girl of Manzanares who could talk in the Latin
tongue, which she had been taught by a Jesuit priest, an episode
which he retold in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
shall we hear,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;of an English rector
instructing a beggar girl in the language of Cicero?&rdquo;&nbsp;
To which Mr. Brandram, who was rector of Beckenham, replied
&ldquo;Cui bono?&rdquo;&nbsp; The letters of this period are the
best that he ever wrote, and are incorporated more exactly than
the earlier ones in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.</p>
<p>Four letters to his mother within the period of his second and
third visits may well be presented together here from my Borrow
Papers:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. Ann Borrow</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Madrid</span>,
<i>July</i> 27, 1838.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I am in
perfect health though just returned from a long expedition in
which I have been terribly <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>burnt by the sun.&nbsp; In about ten
days I sold nearly a thousand Testaments among the labourers of
the plains and mountains of Castille and La Mancha.&nbsp;
Everybody in Madrid is wondering and saying such a thing is a
miracle, as I have not entered a town, and the country people are
very poor and have never seen or heard of the Testament
before.&nbsp; But I confess to you that I dislike my situation
and begin to think that I have been deceived; the B.S. have had
another person on the sea-coast who has nearly ruined their cause
in Spain by circulating seditious handbills and tracts.&nbsp; The
consequence has been that many of my depots have been seized in
which I kept my Bibles in various parts of the country, for the
government think that he is employed by me; I told the B.S. all
along what would be the consequence of employing this man, but
they took huff and would scarce believe me, and now all my words
are come true; I do not blame the government in the slightest
degree for what they have done in many points, they have shown
themselves to be my good friends, but they have been driven to
the step by the insane conduct of the person alluded to.&nbsp; I
told them frankly in my last letter that I would leave their
service if they encouraged him; for I will not be put in prison
again on his account, and lose another servant by the gaol fever,
and then obtain neither thanks nor reward.&nbsp; I am going out
of town again in a day or two, but I shall now write very
frequently, therefore be not alarmed for I will run into no
danger.&nbsp; Burn this letter and speak to no one about it, nor
any others that I may send.&nbsp; God bless you, my dear
mother.</p>

merely write this to inform you that I am back to Madrid from my
expedition.&nbsp; I have been very successful and have sold a
great many Testaments.&nbsp; Indeed all the villages and towns
within thirty miles have been supplied.&nbsp; In Madrid itself I
can do nothing as I am closely watched by order of the government
and not permitted to sell, so that all I do is by riding out to
places where they cannot follow me.&nbsp; I do not blame them,
for they have much to complain of, though nothing of me, but if
the Society will countenance such men as they have lately done in
the South of Spain they must expect to reap the
consequences.&nbsp; It is very probable that I may come to
England in a little time, and then you will see me; but do not
talk any more about yourself being &ldquo;no more seen,&rdquo;

to make me melancholy already.&nbsp; I am in a great hurry and

</blockquote>
<p>It was in the middle of his third and last visit to Spain that
Borrow wrote this next letter to his mother which gives the first
suggestion of the romantic and happy termination of his final
visit to the Peninsula:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. Ann Borrow</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Seville</span>,
<span class="smcap">Spain</span>, <i>April</i> 27, 1839.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I should have
written to you before I left Madrid, but I had a long and
dangerous journey to make, and I wished to get it over before
saying anything to you.&nbsp; I am now safely arrived, by the
blessing of God, in Seville, which, in my opinion, is the most
delightful town in the world.&nbsp; If it were not a strange
place with a strange language I know you would like to live in
it, but it is rather too late in the day for you to learn Spanish
and accommodate yourself to Spanish ways.&nbsp; Before I left
Madrid I accomplished a great deal, having sold upwards of one
thousand Testaments and nearly five hundred Bibles, so that at
present very few remain; indeed, not a single Bible, and I was
obliged to send away hundreds of people who wanted to purchase,
but whom I could not supply.&nbsp; All this has been done without
the slightest noise or disturbance or anything that could give
cause of displeasure to the government, so that I am now on very
good terms with the authorities, though they are perfectly aware
of what I am about.&nbsp; Should the Society think proper to be
guided by the experience which I have acquired, and my knowledge
of the country and the people, they might if they choosed sell at
least twelve thousand Bibles and Testaments yearly in Spain, but
let them adopt or let any other people adopt any other principle
than that on which I act and everything will miscarry.&nbsp; All
the difficulties, as I told my friends the time I was in England,
which I have had to encounter were owing to the faults and
imprudencies of other people, and, I may say, still <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>are
owing.&nbsp; Two Methodist schoolmasters have lately settled at
Cadiz, and some little time ago took it into their heads to speak
and preach, as I am informed, against the Virgin Mary;
information was instantly sent to Madrid, and the blame, or part
of it, was as usual laid to me; however, I found means to clear
myself, for I have powerful friends in Madrid, who are well
acquainted with my views, and who interested themselves for me,
otherwise I should have been sent out of the country, as I
believe the two others have been or will be.&nbsp; I have said
nothing on this point in my letters home, as people would perhaps
say that I was lukewarm, whereas, on the contrary, I think of
nothing but the means best adapted to promote the cause; but I am
not one of those disposed to run a ship on a rock when only a
little skill is necessary to keep her in the open sea.</p>
<p>I hope Mrs. Clarke will write shortly; tell her if she wishes
for a retreat I have found one here for her and Henrietta.&nbsp;
I have my eye on a beautiful one at fifteen pence a day.&nbsp; I
call it a small house, though it is a paradise in its way, having
a stable, courtyard, fountain, and twenty rooms.&nbsp; She has
only to write to my address at Madrid and I shall receive the
letter without fail.&nbsp; Henrietta had better bring with her a
Spanish grammar and pocket dictionary, as not a word of English
is spoken here.&nbsp; The house-dog&mdash;perhaps a real English
bulldog would be better&mdash;likewise had better come, as it may
be useful.&nbsp; God bless you therefore for the present, my
dearest mother.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow had need of friends more tolerant of his idiosyncrasies
than the &ldquo;powerful friends&rdquo; he describes to his
mother, for the worthy secretary of the Bible Society was still
in a critical mood:</p>
<blockquote><p>You narrate your perilous journey to Seville, and
say at the beginning of the description, &ldquo;my usual
wonderful good fortune accompanying us.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a
mood of speaking to which we are not accustomed&mdash;it savours,
some of our friends would say, a little of the profane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find among my papers an interesting letter to Mrs. Clarke of
this period:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. Clarke</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Seville</span>,
10 <i>January</i>, 1839.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;As I left
England very suddenly and had many preparations to make at
exceedingly short notice, I was unable to perform my wish, and I
believe my promise, of writing <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>to you before my departure.&nbsp; I
took shipping at Falmouth and arrived at Cadiz without any
circumstance worthy of remark occurring.&nbsp; I am now, and have
been for the last week, in Seville, the principal town of
Andalusia, one of the most beautiful provinces in Spain.&nbsp; I
proceed to Madrid within a few days, but it is my intention to
return as soon as possible to these parts, and commence
operations here, where up to the present moment nothing has been
done towards propagating the word of God.&nbsp; Indeed my sole
motive for visiting Madrid, and subjecting myself to a fatiguing
journey through a country which I have already twice traversed,
is to furnish myself with a sufficient stock of Testaments for
distribution in the principal villages of Andalusia, as it is my
intention to address myself chiefly to the peasantry, whom
hitherto I have invariably found far more docile to instruction,
and eager to acquire knowledge, than the brethren of the large
towns.&nbsp; I intend, however, to make Seville my headquarters,
and a depot for the books intended for other places.&nbsp;
Nothing can be more delightful than the situation of this place,
which stands on the eastern bank of the Guadalquivir, the largest
river in Spain, with the exception of the Ebro; smiling meadows,
orange-groves and gardens encompass it on every side; while far
away towards the south east are descried the blue ridges and
misty pinnacles of the noble chain of mountains called the
Sierrania de Ronda.&nbsp; The streets are narrow and crooked like
those of all the old Spanish and Moorish towns.&nbsp; Indeed in
many of them, whilst standing in the middle, you can touch both
sides with your hands extended.&nbsp; Yet the narrowness of the
streets is by no means an inconvenience in this climate,
especially in the summer when the sun burns with great heat and
fury, but on the contrary is a very great comfort, as the hot
beams are excluded, and the houses by this means kept seasonably
cool.&nbsp; Nothing pleases me more than the manner in which the
houses of Seville are built.&nbsp; They are, for the most part,
of two stories, which surround a quadrangular court, of large or
small dimensions, according to the size of the edifice&mdash;the
upper story being furnished with a gallery overhanging the court,
and offering an agreeable place for walking to those not disposed
to go abroad.&nbsp; In most of the courts is a stone fountain,
continually streaming with cool and delicious water, and not
unfrequently at the angles orange trees are planted, which
perfume the air with their fruit and blossoms.&nbsp; There are
many magnificent edifices in Seville, especially the Cathedral
and Alcazar or castle.&nbsp; The former is indeed a glorious
pile, constructed at various periods, and so large and covering
so much ground that St. Paul&rsquo;s, magnificent edifice as it
certainly is, would look contemptible, if placed by its
side.&nbsp; Its tower which is called La Giralda is the work of
the Moors, and once formed part of a mosque, and was the place
from which the Imams at morn and eve summoned the children of
Ismael to their devotions with the awful and true cry
&ldquo;There is but one God&rdquo;; stultified however by the
sequence &ldquo;Mahomet is the Prophet <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Alcazar is also the work of the Moors, and
was the palace of their kings as long as they lorded on the banks
of the Guadalquivir; it contains halls of grandeur indescribable,
and which are worthy specimens of the perfection to which
architecture was carried in Spain by the Moors who certainly
deserve to be styled Lords of Masonry, and who perhaps were upon
the whole the most extraordinary nation which has appeared upon
the earth since the time of the creation.</p>
<p>I must however proceed no further at present in describing the
remarkable objects of Seville as there are other matters which I
must now touch upon, and which relate immediately to
yourself.&nbsp; Respecting your questions as to what quarter I
would advise you to direct your course, as soon as your affairs
shall have been arranged to your satisfaction, I beg leave to
answer that I do not think that yourself and Miss Hen. could do
better than come out to Seville, for a time, where you would be
far out of the reach of the malignity of your ill-wishers, and
might soon become useful helpers in the cause of God.&nbsp; With
your income you might live here with the greatest respectability,
tenant one of the charming houses, which I have just described,
and enjoy one of the finest climates in the world.&nbsp;
Therefore you had better give this point your very serious
consideration.&nbsp; I do not think that Colchester or Edinburgh
would please you half so much as Seville, where you would find a
few excellent and worthy English families, long established in
Spain, and following with great success the pursuits of
commerce.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be well to invest part of your money in the
purchase of some vessel trading to the Mediterranean if such
extraordinary good interest, with perfect security, can be
obtained, as you have stated.&nbsp; However, pray act with the
greatest caution and endeavour thoroughly to know your people
before you place confidence in any person.&nbsp; Should Mr. W.
apply to you again, I think you may tell him that you will
reconsider the matter provided he will give you one thousand
pounds for your interest in your charming little estate.&nbsp; I
have no doubt that he would comply.</p>
<p>The best general advice that I can give you for the present is
to make the most of any species of property which you may deem it
advisable to dispose of, and by no precipitate haste run the risk
of incurring a loss.&nbsp; Let no person persuade you, whether
legal adviser or not, to take any step by which you may deem that
your interests will be in the slightest degree compromised, and
be reserved in your communications to all respecting your
ultimate intentions.&nbsp; I shall write to you speedily from
Madrid and then I hope to have the satisfaction of hearing from
you.</p>
<p>Pray let Hen. continue to collect as much money as possible
towards affording spiritual instruction to the Spanish
Gypsies.&nbsp; Pay a visit to dear Mrs. Ritson and communicate to
her my best remembrances and kindest regards and inform her at
the <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>same
time that if she please she may subscribe in this good
cause.&nbsp; I am shortly about to publish, on my own account, a
work which I hope will prove of no slight spiritual benefit to
these unhappy people.&mdash;I remain, dearest Madam, ever
yours,</p>

<p>On 29th July, 1839, Borrow was instructed by his Committee to
return to England, but he was already on the way to Tangier,
whence in September he wrote a long and interesting letter to Mr.
Brandram, which was afterwards incorporated in <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>.&nbsp; He had left Mrs. Clarke and her daughter in
Seville, and they joined him at Gibraltar later.&nbsp; We find
him <i>en route</i> for Tangier, staying two days with Mr. John
M. Brackenbury, the British Consul in Cadiz, who found him a most
fascinating man.</p>
<p>His Tangier life is fully described in <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>.&nbsp; Here he picked up a Jewish youth, Hayim Ben
Attar, who returned to Spain as his servant, and afterwards to
England.</p>
<p>Borrow, at the end of September, was back again in Seville, in
his house near the cathedral, in the Plazuela de la Pila Seca,
which, when I visited Seville in the spring of the year 1913, I
found had long been destroyed to make way for new
buildings.&nbsp; Here he received the following letter from Mr.
George Browne of the Bible Society:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mr. Borrow</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Bible
House</span>, <i>Oct.</i> 7, 1839.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Mr. Brandram
and myself being both on the eve of a long journey, I have only
time to inform you that yours of the 2d ult. from Tangier, and
21st from Cadiz came to hand this morning.&nbsp; Before this time
you have doubtless received Mr. Brandram&rsquo;s letter,
accompanying the resolution of the Comee., of which I apprised
you, but which was delayed a few days, for the purpose of
reconsideration.&nbsp; We are not able to suggest precisely the
course you should take in regard to the books left at Madrid and
elsewhere, and how far it may be absolutely necessary or not for
you to visit that city again before you return.&nbsp; The books
you speak of, as at Seville, may be sent to Gibraltar rather than
to England, as well as any books you <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>may deem it expedient or find it
necessary to bring out of the country.&nbsp; As soon as your
arrangements are completed we shall look for the pleasure of
seeing you in this country.&nbsp; The haste in which I am
compelled to write allows me to say no more than that my best
wishes attend you, and that I am, with sincere regard, yours
truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">G.
Browne</span>.</p>
<p>I thank you for your kind remembrance of Mrs. Browne.&nbsp;
Did I thank you for your letter to her?&nbsp; She feels, I assure
you, very much obliged.&nbsp; Your description of Tangier will be
another interesting &ldquo;morceau&rdquo; for her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Borrow?&rdquo; asked the Bible Society
meanwhile of the Consuls at Seville and Cadiz, but Borrow had
ceased to care.&nbsp; He hoped to become a successful author with
his <i>Gypsies</i>; he would at any rate secure independence by
marriage, which must have been already mooted.&nbsp; In November
he and Mrs. Clarke were formally betrothed, and would have been
married in Spain, but a Protestant marriage was impossible
there.&nbsp; When preparing to leave Seville he had one of those
fiery quarrels with which his life was to be studded.&nbsp; This
time it was with an official of the city over a passport, and the
official promptly locked him up for thirty hours.&nbsp; Hence the
following letter in response to his complaint.&nbsp; The writer
is Mr., afterwards Sir George, Jerningham, then Secretary of
Legation at Madrid, who, it may be mentioned, came from
Costessey, four miles from Norwich.&nbsp; It is written from the
British Legation, and is dated 23rd December, 1839:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of
your two letters, the one without date, the second dated the
19<i>th</i> <i>November</i> (which however ought to have been
<i>December</i>), respecting the outrageous conduct pursued
towards you at Seville by the Alcalde of the district in which
you resided.&nbsp; I lost no time in addressing a strong
representation thereon to the Spanish Minister, and I have to
inform you that he has acquainted me with his having written to
Seville for exact information upon the whole subject, and that he
has promised a further answer to my representation as soon as his
inquiries shall have been answered.&nbsp; In the meantime I shall
not fail to follow up your case with proper activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was still in Seville, hard at work upon the
<i>Gypsies</i>, all through the first three months of the year
1840.&nbsp; In April the three friends left Cadiz for
London.&nbsp; A letter of <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>this period from Mr. Brackenbury,
the British Consul at Cadiz, is made clear by these facts:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">British
Consulate</span>, <span class="smcap">Cadiz</span>,
<i>January</i> 27<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I received on
the 19th your very acceptable letter without date, and am
heartily rejoiced to find that you have received satisfaction for
the insult, and that the Alcalde is likely to be punished for his
unjustifiable conduct.&nbsp; If you come to Cadiz your baggage
may be landed and deposited at the gates to be shipped with
yourselves wherever the steamer may go, in which case the
authorities would not examine it, if you bring it into Cadiz it
would be examined at the gates&mdash;or, if you were to get it
examined at the Custom House at Seville and there sealed with the
seal of the Customs&mdash;it might then be transhipped into the
steamer or into any other vessel without being subjected to any
examination.&nbsp; If you take your horse, the agents of the
steamer ought to be apprized of your intention, that they may be
prepared, which I do not think they generally are, with a
suitable box.</p>
<p>Consuls are not authorised to unite Protestant subjects in the
bonds of Holy Matrimony in popish countries&mdash;which seems a
peculiar hardship, because popish priests could not, if they
would&mdash;hence in Spain no Protestants can be legally
married.&nbsp; Marriages solemnised abroad according to the law
of that land wheresoever the parties may at the time be
inhabitants are valid&mdash;but the law of Spain excludes their
priests from performing these ceremonies where both parties are
Protestants&mdash;and where one is a Papist, except a
dispensation be obtained from the Pope.&nbsp; So you must either
go to Gibraltar&mdash;or wait till you arrive in England.&nbsp; I
have represented the hardship of such a case more than once or
twice to Government.&nbsp; In my report upon the Consular Act, 6
<span class="smcap">Geo.</span> IV. cap. 87&mdash;eleven years
ago&mdash;I suggested that provision should be made to legalise
marriages solemnised by the Consul within the Consulate, and that
such marriages should be registered in the Consular
Office&mdash;and that duly certified copies thereof should be
equivalent to certificates of marriages registered in any church
in England.&nbsp; These suggestions not having been acted upon, I
brought the matter under the consideration of Lord John Russell
(I being then in England at the time of his altering the Marriage
Act), and proposed that Consuls abroad should have the power of
magistrates and civil authorities at home for receiving the
declarations of British subjects who might wish to enter into the
marriage state&mdash;but they feared lest the introduction of
such a clause, simple and efficacious as it would have been,
might have endangered the fate of the Bill; and so we are as
Protestants deprived of all power of being legally married in
Spain.</p>

course enquire whether your Arab may be legally exported.</p>

130</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smcap">Borrow&rsquo;s Spanish Circle</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many interesting
personalities that pass before us in Borrow&rsquo;s three
separate narratives, as they may be considered, of his Spanish
experiences.&nbsp; We would fain know more concerning the two
excellent secretaries of the Bible Society&mdash;Samuel Brandram
and Joseph Jowett.&nbsp; We merely know that the former was
rector of Beckenham and was one of the Society&rsquo;s
secretaries until his death in 1850; that the latter was rector
of Silk Willoughby in Lincolnshire, and belonged to the same
family as Jowett of Balliol.&nbsp; But there are many quaint
characters in Borrow&rsquo;s own narrative to whom we are
introduced.&nbsp; There is Maria Diaz, for example, his landlady
in the house in the Calle de Santiago in Madrid, and her husband,
Juan Lopez, also assisted Borrow in his Bible distribution.&nbsp;
Very eloquent are Borrow&rsquo;s tributes to the pair in the
pages of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Honour to Maria
Diaz, the quiet, dauntless, clever, Castilian female!&nbsp; I
were an ingrate not to speak well of her.&rdquo;&nbsp; We get a
glimpse of Maria and her husband long years afterwards&mdash;a
pensioner in a Spanish almshouse revealing himself as the son of
Borrow&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; Eduardo Lopez was only eight years
of age when Borrow was in Madrid, and he really adds nothing to
our knowledge.&nbsp; Then there were those two incorrigible
vagabonds&mdash;Antonio Buchini, his Greek servant with an
Italian name, and Benedict Mol, the Swiss of Lucerne, who turns
up in all sorts of improbable circumstances as the seeker of
treasure in the Church of St. James of Compostella&mdash;only a
masterly imagination could have made him so interesting.&nbsp;
Concerning these there is nothing to supplement Borrow&rsquo;s
own story.&nbsp; But we have attractive glimpses of Borrow in the
frequently quoted narrative of Colonel Napier, and this is so
illuminating that I venture to reproduce it at greater length
than previous biographers have done.&nbsp; Edward Elers Napier,
who was born <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>in 1808, was the son of one Edward Elers of the Royal
Navy.&nbsp; His widow married the famous Admiral Sir Charles
Napier, who adopted her four children by her first husband.&nbsp;
Edward Elers, the younger, or Edward Napier, as he came to be
called, was educated at Sandhurst and entered the army, serving
for some years in India.&nbsp; Later his regiment was ordered to
Gibraltar, and it was thence that he made several sporting
excursions into Spain and Morocco.&nbsp; Later he served in
Egypt, and when, through ill-health, he retired in 1843 on
half-pay, he lived for some years in Portugal.&nbsp; In 1854 he
returned to the army and did good work in the Crimea, becoming a
lieutenant-general in 1864.&nbsp; He died in 1870.&nbsp; He
wrote, in addition to these <i>Excursions</i>, several other
books, including <i>Scenes and Sports in Foreign Lands</i>.&nbsp;
It was during his military career at Gibraltar that he met George
Borrow at Seville, as the following extracts from his book
testify.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s pretension to have visited the East
is characteristic&mdash;and amusing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1839.&nbsp; <i>Saturday</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Out
early, sketching at the Alcazar.&nbsp; After breakfast it set in
a day of rain, and I was reduced to wander about the galleries
overlooking the &ldquo;patio.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing so dreary and
out of character as a rainy day in Spain.&nbsp; Whilst occupied
in moralising over the dripping water-spouts, I observed a tall,
gentlemanly-looking man, dressed in a zamarra, leaning over the
balustrades, and apparently engaged in a similar manner with
myself.&nbsp; Community of thoughts and occupation generally
tends to bring people together.&nbsp; From the stranger&rsquo;s
complexion, which was fair, but with brilliant black eyes, I
concluded he was not a Spaniard; in short, there was something so
remarkable in his appearance that it was difficult to say to what
nation he might belong.&nbsp; He was tall, with a commanding
appearance; yet, though apparently in the flower of manhood, his
hair was so deeply tinged with the winter of either age or sorrow
as to be nearly snow-white.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, I
was rather puzzled as to what language I should address him
in.&nbsp; At last, putting a bold face on the matter, I
approached him with a &ldquo;Bonjour, monsieur, quel triste
temps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied he in the purest Parisian
accent; &ldquo;and it is very unusual weather here at this time
of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does &lsquo;monsieur&rsquo; intend to be any time at
Seville?&rdquo; asked I.&nbsp; He replied in the
affirmative.&nbsp; We were soon on a friendly footing, and from
his varied information I was both amused and instructed.&nbsp;
Still I became more than ever in the dark as to his nationality;
I found he could speak English as fluently as French.&nbsp; I
tried him on the Italian track; again he was perfectly at
home.&nbsp; He had a Greek servant, to whom he gave his orders in
Roma&iuml;c.&nbsp; <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>He conversed in good Castilian with &ldquo;mine
host&rdquo;; exchanged a German salutation with an Austrian
Baron, at the time an inmate of the fonda; and on mentioning to
him my morning visit to Triano, which led to some remarks on the
gypsies, and the probable place from whence they derived their
origin, he expressed his belief that it was from Moultan, and
said that, even to this day, they retained many Moultanee and
Hindoostanee expressions, such as &ldquo;p&aacute;nee&rdquo;
(water), &ldquo;buree p&aacute;nee&rdquo; (the sea), etc.&nbsp;
He was rather startled when I replied &ldquo;in Hindee,&rdquo;
but was delighted on finding I was an Indian, and entered freely,
and with depth and acuteness, on the affairs of the East, most of
which part of the world he had visited.</p>
<p>In such varied discourse did the hours pass so swiftly away
that we were not a little surprised when P&eacute;p&eacute;, the
&ldquo;mozo&rdquo; (and I verily believe all Spanish waiters are
called P&eacute;p&eacute;), announced the hour of dinner; after
which we took a long walk together on the banks of the
river.&nbsp; But, on our return, I was as much as ever in
ignorance as to who might be my new and pleasant
acquaintance.</p>
<p>I took the first opportunity of questioning Antonio Baillie
(Buchini) on the subject, and his answer only tended to increase
my curiosity.&nbsp; He said that nobody knew what nation the
&ldquo;mysterious Unknown&rdquo; belonged to, nor what were his
motives for travelling.&nbsp; In his passport he went by the name
of &mdash;, and as a British subject, but in consequence of a
suspicion being entertained that he was a Russian spy, the police
kept a sharp look-out over him.&nbsp; Spy or no spy, I found him
a very agreeable companion; and it was agreed that on the
following day we should visit together the ruins of Italica.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 5.&mdash;After breakfast, the &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo;
and myself, mounting our horses, proceeded on our expedition to
the ruins of Italica.&nbsp; Crossing the river, and proceeding
through the populous suburb of Triano, already mentioned, we went
over the same extensive plain that I had traversed in going to
San Lucar, but keeping a little more to the right a short ride
brought us in sight of the Convent of San Isidrio, surrounded by
tall cypress and waving date-trees.&nbsp; This once
richly-endowed religious establishment is, together with the
small neighbouring village of Santi Ponci, I believe, the
property of the Duke of Medina Coeli, at whose expense the
excavations are now carried on at the latter place, which is the
ancient site of the Roman Italica.</p>
<p>We sat down on a fragment of the walls, and sadly recalling
the splendour of those times of yore, contrasted with the
desolation around us, the &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; began to feel the
vein of poetry creeping through his inward soul, and gave vent to
it by reciting, with great emphasis and effect, and to the
astonishment of the wondering peasant, who must have thought him
&ldquo;loco,&rdquo; the following well-known and beautiful
lines:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower, grown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Matted and massed together, hillocks heap&rsquo;d<br
/>
<a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>On what
were chambers, arch crush&rsquo;d, column strown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In fragments, choked up vaults, and frescoes
steep&rsquo;d<br />
In subterranean damps, where the owl peep&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeming it midnight; Temples, baths, or
halls&mdash;<br />
Pronounce who can: for all that Learning reap&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From her research hath been, that these are
walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been too much taken up with the scene, the verses, and
the strange being who was repeating them with so much feeling, to
notice the approach of one who now formed the fourth person of
our party.&nbsp; This was a slight female figure, beautiful in
the extreme, but whose tattered garments, raven hair (which fell
in matted elf-locks over her naked shoulders), swarthy
complexion, and flashing eyes, proclaimed to be of the wandering
tribe of &ldquo;gitanos.&rdquo;&nbsp; From an intuitive sense of
natural politeness she stood with crossed arms, and a slight
smile on her dark and handsome countenance, until my companion
had ceased, and then addressed us in the usual whining tone of
supplication, with &ldquo;Caballeritos, una limosita!&nbsp; Dios
se lo pagara a ustedes!&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Gentlemen, a little
charity!&nbsp; God will repay it to you!&rdquo;)&nbsp; The gypsy
girl was so pretty, and her voice so sweet, that I involuntarily
put my hand in my pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you remember what I told you about the Eastern origin
of these people?&nbsp; You shall see I am correct.&nbsp; Come
here, my pretty child,&rdquo; said he in Moultanee, &ldquo;and
tell me where are the rest of your tribe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked astounded, replied in the same tongue, but in
broken language; when, taking him by the arm, she said, in
Spanish: &ldquo;Come, caballero; come to one who will be able to
answer you;&rdquo; and she led the way down amongst the ruins
towards one of the dens formerly occupied by the wild beasts, and
disclosed to us a set of beings scarcely less savage.&nbsp; The
sombre walls of this gloomy abode were illumined by a fire, the
smoke from which escaped through a deep fissure in the massy
roof; whilst the flickering flames threw a blood-red glare on the
bronzed features of a group of children, of two men, and a
decrepit old hag; who appeared busily engaged in some culinary
preparations.</p>
<p>On our entrance, the scowling glance of the males of the
party, and a quick motion of the hand towards the folds of the
&ldquo;faja,&rdquo; caused in <i>me</i>, at least, anything but a
comfortable sensation; but their hostile intentions, if ever
entertained, were immediately removed by a wave of the hand from
our conductress, who, leading my companion towards the sibyl,
whispered something in her ear.&nbsp; The old crone appeared
incredulous.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; uttered one word;
but that word had the effect of magic; she prostrated herself at
his feet, and in an instant, from an object of suspicion he
became one of worship to the whole family, to whom, on taking
leave, he made a handsome present, and departed with their united
blessings, to the astonishment of myself, and what looked very
like terror in our Spanish guide.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>I
was, as the phrase goes, dying with curiosity, and, as soon as we
mounted our horses, exclaimed, &ldquo;Where, in the name of
goodness, did you pick up your acquaintance and the language of
these extraordinary people?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Some years ago,
in Moultan,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And by what means do
you possess such apparent influence over them?&rdquo;&nbsp; But
the &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; had already said more than he perhaps
wished on the subject.&nbsp; He drily replied that he had more
than once owed his life to gipsies, and had reason to know them
well; but this was said in a tone which precluded all further
queries on my part.&nbsp; The subject was never again broached,
and we returned in silence to the fonda. . . .</p>
<p><i>May</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Pouring with rain all day, during
which I was mostly in the society of the
&ldquo;Unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a most extraordinary
character, and the more I see of him the more I am puzzled.&nbsp;
He appears acquainted with everybody and everything, but
apparently unknown to every one himself.&nbsp; Though his figure
bespeaks youth&mdash;and by his own account his age does not
exceed thirty&mdash;yet the snows of eighty winters could not
have whitened his locks more completely than they are.&nbsp; But
in his dark and searching eye there is an almost supernatural
penetration and lustre, which, were I inclined to superstition,
might induce me to set down its possessor as a second Melmoth;
and in that character he often appears to me during the troubled
rest I sometimes obtain through the medium of the great soother,
&ldquo;laudanum.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next most interesting figure in the Borrow gallery of this
period is Don Luis de Us&oacute;z y Rio, who was a good friend to
Borrow during the whole of his sojourn in Spain.&nbsp; It was he
who translated Borrow&rsquo;s appeal to the Spanish Prime
Minister to be permitted to distribute Scio&rsquo;s New
Testament.&nbsp; He watched over Borrow with brotherly
solicitude, and wrote him more than one excellent letter, of
which the two following from my Borrow Papers, the last written
at the close of the Spanish period, are the most interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mr. George Borrow</span><br />
(<i>Translated from the Spanish</i>)</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Piazza di
Spagna</span> 47, <span class="smcap">Rome</span>, 7
<i>April</i>, 1838.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I received your
letter, and thank you for the same.&nbsp; I know the works under
the name of &ldquo;Boz,&rdquo; about which you write, and also
the <i>Memoirs of the Pickwick Club</i>, and although they seemed
to me good, I have failed to appreciate properly their qualities,
because much of the dramatic style and dialogue in the same are
very difficult for those who know English merely from
books.&nbsp; I made here a better acquaintance <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>than that
of Mezzofanti (who knows nothing), namely, that of Prof.
Michel-Angelo Lanci, already well known on account of his work,
<i>La sacra scrittura illustrata con monumenti fenico-assiri ed
egiziani</i>, etc., etc.&nbsp; (The Scriptures, illustrated with
Ph&oelig;nician-Assyrian and Egyptian monuments), which I am
reading at present, and find very profound and interesting, and
more particularly very original.&nbsp; He has written and
presented me a book, <i>Esposizione dei versetti del Giobbe
intorno al cavallo</i> (Explanation of verses of Job about a
horse), and in these and other works he proves himself to be a
great philologist and Oriental scholar.&nbsp; I meet him almost
daily, and I assure you that he seems to me to know everything he
treats thoroughly, and not like Gayangos or Calderon, etc.,
etc.&nbsp; His philosophic works have created a great stir here,
and they do not please much the friars here; but as here they are
not like the police barbarians there, they do not forbid it, as
they cannot.&nbsp; Lanci is well known in Russia and in Germany,
and when I bring his works there, and you are there and have not
read them, you will read them and judge for yourself.</p>
<p>Wishing you well, and always at your service, I remain, always
yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Luis de Usoz y
Rio</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mr. George Borrow</span><br />
(<i>Translated from the Spanish</i>)</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Naples</span>,
28 <i>August</i>, 1839.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I received your
letter of the 28 July written from Sevilla, and I am waiting for
that which you promise me from Tangier.</p>
<p>I am glad that you liked Sevilla, and I am still more glad of
the successful shipment of the beloved book.&nbsp; In
distributing it, you are rendering the greatest service that
generous foreigners (I mean Englishmen) can render to the real
freedom and enlightenment in Spain, and any Spaniard who is at
heart a gentleman must be grateful for this service to the
Society and to its agent.&nbsp; In my opinion, if Spain had
maintained the customs, character, and opinions that it had three
centuries ago, it ought to have maintained also unity in
religious opinions: but that at present the circumstances have
changed, and the moral character and the advancement of my
unfortunate country would not lose anything in its purification
and progress by (the grant of) religious liberty.</p>
<p>You are saying that I acted very light-mindedly in judging
Mezzofanti without speaking to him.&nbsp; You know that the other
time when I was in Italy I had dealings and spoke with him, and
that I said to you that he had a great facility for speaking
languages, but that otherwise he was no good.&nbsp; Because I
have seen him several times in the Papal chapels with a certain
air <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>of
an ass and certain grimaces of a blockhead that cannot happen to
a man of talent.&nbsp; I am told, moreover, that he is a spy, and
that for that reason he was given the hat.&nbsp; I know,
moreover, that he has not written anything at all.&nbsp; For that
reason I do not wish to take the trouble of seeing him.</p>
<p>As regards Lanci, I am not saying anything except that I am
waiting until you have read his work without passion, and that if
my books have arrived at Madrid, you can ask my brother in
Santiago.</p>
<p>You are judging of him and of Pahlin in the way you reproach
me with judging Mezzofanti; I thank you, and I wish for the
dedication Gabricote; and I also wish for your return to Madrid,
so that in going to Toledo you would get a copy of Aristophanes
with the order that will be given to you by my brother, who has
got it.</p>
<p>If for the Gabricote or other work you require my clumsy pen,
write to Florence and send me a rough copy of what is to be done,
in English or in Spanish, and I will supply the finished
work.&nbsp; From Florence I intend to go to London, and I should
be obliged if you would give me letters and instructions that
would be of use to me in literary matters, but you must know that
my want of knowledge of <i>speaking</i> English makes it
necessary that the Englishmen who speak to me should know
Spanish, French, or Italian.</p>
<p>As regards robberies, of which you accuse Southern people,
from the literatures of the North, do you think that the
robberies committed by the Northerners from the Southern
literature would be left behind?&nbsp; Erunt vitia donec
homines.&mdash;Always yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Eleutheros</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another acquaintance of these Spanish days was Baron
Taylor&mdash;Isidore Justin S&eacute;verin Taylor, to give him
his full name&mdash;who had a career of wandering achievement,
with Government pay, that must have appealed to Borrow.&nbsp;
Although his father was an Englishman he became a naturalised
Frenchman, and he was for a time in the service of the French
Government as Director of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;ais, when he had no little share in the production of
the dramas of Victor Hugo and Dumas.&nbsp; Later he was
instrumental in bringing the Luxor obelisk from Egypt to
Paris.&nbsp; He wrote books upon his travels in Spain, Portugal
and Morocco.&nbsp; He wandered all over Europe in search of art
treasures for the French Government, and may very well have met
Borrow again and again.&nbsp; Borrow tells us that he had met
Taylor in France, in Russia, and in Ireland, before he met him in
Andalusia, collecting pictures for the French Government.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s description of their meetings is
inimitable:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>Whenever he descries me, whether in the street or the
desert, the brilliant hall or amongst Bedouin <i>haimas</i>, at
Novogorod or Stambul, he flings up his arms and exclaims,
&ldquo;<i>O ciel</i>!&nbsp; I have again the felicity of seeing
my cherished and most respectable Borrow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last and most distinguished of Borrow&rsquo;s colleagues
while in Spain was George Villiers, fourth Earl of Clarendon,
whom we judge to have been in private life one of the most
lovable men of his epoch.&nbsp; George Villiers was born in
London in 1800, and was the grandson of the first Earl, Thomas
Villiers, who received his title when holding office in Lord
North&rsquo;s administration, but is best known from his
association in diplomacy with Frederick the Great.&nbsp; His
grandson was born, as it were, into diplomacy, and at twenty
years of age was an <i>attach&eacute;</i> to the British Embassy
in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; Later he was associated with Sir John
Bowring in negotiating a commercial treaty with France.&nbsp; In
August, 1833, he was sent as British Minister&mdash;&ldquo;envoy
extraordinary&rdquo; he was called&mdash;to Madrid, and he had
been two years in that seething-pot of Spanish affairs, with
Christinos and Carlists at one another&rsquo;s throats, when
Borrow arrived in the Peninsula.&nbsp; His influence was the
greater with a succession of Spanish Prime Ministers in that in
1838 he had been largely instrumental in negotiating the
quadruple alliance between England, France, Spain, and
Portugal.&nbsp; In March, 1839&mdash;exactly a year before Borrow
took his departure&mdash;he resigned his position at Madrid,
having then for some months exchanged the title of Sir George
Villiers for that of Earl of Clarendon through the death of his
uncle; Borrow thereafter having to launch his various complaints
and grievances at his successor, Mr.&mdash;afterwards Sir
George&mdash;Jerningham, who, it has been noted, had his home in
Norfolk, at Costessey, four miles from Norwich.&nbsp; Villiers
returned to England with a great reputation, although his Spanish
policy was attacked in the House of Lords.&nbsp; In that same
year, 1839, he joined Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s administration as
Lord Privy Seal, O&rsquo;Connell at the time declaring that he
ought to be made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, so sympathetic was
he towards concession and conciliation in that then feverishly
excited country.&nbsp; This office actually came to him in 1847,
and he was Lord-Lieutenant through that dark period of
Ireland&rsquo;s history, <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>including the Famine, the Young
Ireland rebellion, and the Smith O&rsquo;Brien rising.&nbsp; He
pleased no one in Ireland.&nbsp; No English statesman could ever
have done so under such ideals of government as England would
have tolerated then, and for long years afterwards.&nbsp; The
Whigs defended him, the Tories abused him, in their respective
organs.&nbsp; He left Ireland in 1852 and was more than once
mentioned as possible Prime Minister in the ensuing years.&nbsp;
He was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Lord
Aberdeen&rsquo;s administration during the Crimean War, and he
held the same office under Lord Palmerston, again under Lord John
Russell in 1865, and under Mr. Gladstone in 1868.&nbsp; He might
easily have become Prime Minister.&nbsp; Greville in his
<i>Diary</i> writes of Prince Albert&rsquo;s desire that he
should succeed Lord John Russell, but Clarendon said that no
power on earth would make him take that position.&nbsp; He said
he could not speak, and had not had parliamentary experience
enough.&nbsp; He died in 1870, leaving a reputation as a skilful
diplomatist and a disinterested politician, if not that of a
great statesman.&nbsp; He had twice refused the
Governor-Generalship of India, and three times a marquisate.</p>
<p>Sir George Villiers seems to have been very courteous to
Borrow during the whole of the time they were together in
Spain.&nbsp; It would have been easy for him to have been quite
otherwise.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s Bible mission synchronised with a
very delicate diplomatic mission of his own, and in a measure
clashed with it.&nbsp; The government of Spain was at the time
fighting the ultra-clericals.&nbsp; Physical and moral strife
were rife in the land.&nbsp; Neither Royalists nor Carlists could
be expected to sympathise with Borrow&rsquo;s schemes, which were
fundamentally to attack their Church.&nbsp; But Villiers was at
all times friendly, and, as far as he could be, helpful.&nbsp;
Borrow seems to have had ready access to him, and he answered his
many letters.&nbsp; He gave Borrow an opportunity of an interview
with the formidable Prime Minister Mendiz&aacute;bal, and he
interviewed another minister and persuaded him to permit Borrow
to print and circulate his Bibles.&nbsp; He intervened
successfully to release Borrow from his Madrid prison.&nbsp; But
Villiers could not have had any sympathy with Borrow other than
as a British subject to be protected on the Roman citizen
principle.&nbsp; We do not suppose that when <i>The Bible in
Spain</i> appeared he was one <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>of those who were captivated by its
extraordinary qualities.&nbsp; When Borrow crossed his path in
later life he received no special consideration, such as would be
given very promptly in our day by a Cabinet minister to a man of
letters of like distinction.&nbsp; We find him on one occasion
writing to the ex-minister, now Lord Clarendon, asking his help
for a consulship.&nbsp; Clarendon replied kindly enough, but
sheltered himself behind the statement that the Prime Minister
was overwhelmed with applications for patronage.&nbsp; Yet
Clarendon, who held many high offices in the following years,
might have helped if he had cared to do so.&nbsp; Some years
later&mdash;in 1847&mdash;there was further correspondence when
Borrow desired to become a Magistrate of Suffolk.&nbsp; Here
again Clarendon wrote three courteous letters, and appears to
have done his best in an unenthusiastic way.&nbsp; But nothing
came of it all.</p>

140</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smcap">Mary Borrow</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many Borrow manuscripts
in my possession I find a page of unusual pathos.&nbsp; It is the
inscription that Borrow wrote for his wife&rsquo;s tomb, and it
is in the tremulous handwriting of a man weighed down by the one
incomparable tragedy of life&rsquo;s pilgrimage:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Sacred to the Memory of Mary Borrow</i>,<br />
<i>the Beloved and Affectionate Wife of</i><br />
<i>George Borrow</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>who departed</i><br />
<i>this Life on the</i> 30<i>th</i> <i>Jan.</i> 1869.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The death of his wife saddened Borrow, and assisted to
transform him into the unamiable creature of Norfolk
tradition.&nbsp; But it is well to bear in mind, when we are
considering Borrow on his domestic and personal side, that he was
unquestionably a good and devoted husband throughout his married
life of twenty-nine years.&nbsp; It was in the year 1832 that
Borrow and his wife first met.&nbsp; He was twenty-nine; she was
a widow of thirty-eight.&nbsp; She was undeniably very
intelligent, and was keenly sympathetic to the young vagabond of
wonderful adventures on the highways of England, now so ambitious
for future adventure in distant lands.&nbsp; Her maiden name was
Mary Skepper.&nbsp; She was one of the two children of Edmund
Skepper and his wife Anne, who lived at Oulton Hall in Suffolk,
whither they had removed from Beccles in 1805.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s
brother inherited the Oulton Hall estate of three hundred acres,
and she had a mortgage, the interest of which yielded &pound;450
per annum.&nbsp; In July, 1817, Mary married, at Oulton Church,
Henry Clarke, a lieutenant in the Navy, who died eight months
later of consumption.&nbsp; Two months after his death their
child Henrietta Mary, the &ldquo;Hen.&rdquo; who was
Borrow&rsquo;s life companion, was born.&nbsp; There is a letter
among my Borrow <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Papers addressed to the widow by her husband&rsquo;s
father at this time.&nbsp; It is dated 17th June, 1818, and runs
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>I read your very kind, affectionate, and
respectful Letter of the 15th Inst, with Feelings of Satisfaction
and thankfulness&mdash;thankful that God has mercifully given you
so pleasing a Pledge of the Love of my late dear, but lamented
son, and I most sincerely hope and trust that dear little
Henrietta will live to be the Joy and Consolation of your Life:
and satisfyed I am that you are what I always esteemed you to be,
<i>one</i> of the best of Women; God grant! that you may be, as I
am sure you deserve to be <i>one</i> of the happiest&mdash;His
Ways of Providence are past finding out; to you&mdash;they seem
indeed to have been truly afflictive: but we cannot possibly say
that they are really so; we cannot doubt His Wisdom nor ought we
to distrust His Goodness, let us avow, then, where we have not
the Power of fathoming&mdash;viz. the dispensations of God; in
His good time He will show us, perhaps, that every painful Event
which has happened was abundantly for the best&mdash;I am truly
glad to hear that you and the sweet Babe, my little grand
Daughter, are doing so well, and I hope I shall have the pleasure
shortly of seeing you either at Oulton or Sisland.&nbsp; I am
sorry to add that neither Poor L. nor myself are
well.&mdash;Louisa and my Family join me in kind love to you, and
in best regards to your worthy Father, Mother, and Brother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary Skepper was certainly a bright, intelligent girl, as I
gather from a manuscript poem before me written to a friend on
the eve of leaving school.&nbsp; As a widow, living at first with
her parents at Oulton Hall, and later with her little daughter in
the neighbouring cottage, she would seem to have busied herself
with all kinds of philanthropies, and she was clearly in sympathy
with the religious enthusiasms of certain neighbouring families
of Evangelical persuasion, particularly the Gurneys and the
Cunninghams.&nbsp; The Rev. Francis Cunningham was rector of
Pakefield, near Lowestoft from 1814 to 1830.&nbsp; He married
Richenda, sister of the distinguished Joseph John Gurney and of
Elizabeth Fry, in 1816.&nbsp; In 1830 he became vicar of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s, Lowestoft.&nbsp; His brother, John William
Cunningham, was vicar of Harrow, and married a Verney of the
famous Buckinghamshire family.&nbsp; This John William Cunningham
was a great light of the Evangelical Churches of his time, and
was for many years editor of <i>The Christian Observer</i>.&nbsp;
His daughter Mary Richenda married Sir James Fitzjames Stephen,
the well-known judge, and the brother of Sir Leslie
Stephen.&nbsp; <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>But to return to Francis Cunningham, whose acquaintance
with Borrow was brought about through Mrs. Clarke.&nbsp;
Cunningham was a great supporter of the British and Foreign Bible
Society, and was the founder of the Paris branch.&nbsp; It was
speedily revealed to him that Borrow&rsquo;s linguistic abilities
could be utilised by the Society, and he secured the co-operation
of his brother-in-law, Joseph John Gurney, in an effort to find
Borrow work in connection with the Society.</p>
<p>We do not meet Mary Clarke again until 1834, when we find a
letter from her to Borrow addressed to St. Petersburg, in which
she notifies to him that he has been &ldquo;mentioned at many of
the Bible Meetings this year,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;dear Mr.
Cunningham&rdquo; had spoken so nicely of him at an Oulton
gathering.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I am not afraid of making you
proud,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;I will tell you one of his
remarks.&nbsp; He mentioned you as one of the most extraordinary
and interesting individuals of the present day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Henceforth clearly Mary Clarke corresponded regularly with
Borrow, and one or two extracts from her letters are given by Dr.
Knapp.&nbsp; Joseph Jowett of the Bible Society forwarded
Borrow&rsquo;s letters from Russia to Cunningham, who handed them
to Mrs. Clarke and her parents.&nbsp; Borrow had proposed to
continue his mission by leaving Russia for China, but this Mary
Clarke opposed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I must tell you that your letter chilled me when I
read your intention of going as a Missionary or Agent, with the
Manchu Scriptures in your hand, to the Tartars, that land of
incalculable dangers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1835 Borrow was back in England at Norwich with his mother,
and on a visit to Mary Clarke and the Skeppers at Oulton.&nbsp;
Mrs. Skepper died just before his arrival in England&mdash;that
is, in September, 1835&mdash;while her husband died in February,
1836.&nbsp; Her only brother died in the following year.</p>
<p>Thus we see Mary Clarke, aged forty-three, left to fight the
world with her daughter, aged nineteen, and not only to fight the
world but her own family, particularly her brother&rsquo;s widow,
owing to certain ambiguities in her father&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; It
was these legal quarrels that led Mary Clarke and her daughter to
set sail for Spain, where Mary <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>had had the indefatigable and
sympathetic correspondent during the previous year of
trouble.&nbsp; Borrow and Mary Clarke met, as we have seen, at
Seville and there, at a later period, they became
&ldquo;engaged.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Clarke and her daughter
Henrietta sailed for Spain in the <i>Royal Tar</i>, leaving
London for Cadiz in June, 1839.&nbsp; Much keen correspondence
between Borrow and Mrs. Clarke had passed before the final
decision to visit Spain.&nbsp; His mother was one of the few
people who knew of Mrs. Clarke&rsquo;s journey to Seville, and
must have understood, as mothers do, what was pending, although
her son did not.&nbsp; When the engagement is announced to
her&mdash;in November, 1839&mdash;she writes to Mary Clarke a
kindly, affectionate letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>I shall now resign him to your care, and may you
love and cherish him as much as I have done.&nbsp; I hope and
trust that each will try to make the other happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no reason whatever to accept the suggestion that has
been made that Borrow married for money.&nbsp; And this because
he had said in one of his letters, &ldquo;It is better to suffer
the halter than the yoke,&rdquo; the kind of thing that a man
might easily say on the eve of making a proposal which he was not
sure would be accepted.&nbsp; Nor can a casual remark of
Borrow&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;marriage is by far the best way of
getting possession of an estate&rdquo;&mdash;be counted as
conclusive.&nbsp; That Borrow was all his life devoted to his
wife I think is proved by his many letters to her that are given
in this volume.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s further tribute to his wife
and stepdaughter in <i>Wild Wales</i> is well known:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of my wife I will merely say that she is a perfect
paragon of wives, can make puddings and sweets and treacle
posset, and is the best woman of business in Eastern
Anglia.&nbsp; Of my stepdaughter&mdash;for such she is, though I
generally call her daughter, and with good reason, seeing that
she has always shown herself a daughter to me&mdash;that she has
all kinds of good qualities, and several accomplishments, knowing
something of conchology, more of botany, drawing capitally in the
Dutch style, and playing remarkably well on the guitar&mdash;not
the trumpery German thing so called, but the real Spanish
guitar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow belonged to the type of men who would never marry did
not some woman mercifully take them in hand.&nbsp; Mrs. Clarke,
when she set out for Spain, had doubtless <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>determined
to marry Borrow.&nbsp; It is clear that he had no idea of
marrying her.&nbsp; Yet he was certainly &ldquo;engaged,&rdquo;
as we learn from a letter to Mr. Brackenbury, when he wrote a
letter from Seville to Mr. Brandram, dated 18th March, in which
he said: &ldquo;I wish very much to spend the remaining years of
my life in the northern parts of China, as I think I have a call
to those regions. . . .&nbsp; I hope yet to die in the cause of
my Redeemer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely never did man take so curious a
view of the responsibilities of marriage.&nbsp; Possibly here
also Borrow was adapting himself to the language of the Bible
Society.&nbsp; He must have known that his proposal would be
declined&mdash;as it was.</p>
<p>Very soon after the engagement Borrow experienced his third
term of imprisonment in Spain, this time, however, only for
thirty hours, and all because he had asked the Alcalde, or mayor
of the district in which he lived, for his passport, and had
quarrelled with his worship over the matter.&nbsp; Borrow gave up
the months of this winter of 1839 rather to writing his first
important book, <i>The Gypsies of Spain</i>, than to the concerns
of the Bible Society, which fidgeted exceedingly, no doubt
imaging heavy bills for expenses, with no corresponding reports
of the usual character to be read out at meetings.&nbsp; Finally
Borrow, with Mrs. Clarke and her daughter, sailed from Cadiz on
the 3rd April, 1840, as we have already related.&nbsp; He had
with him his Jewish servant, Hayim Ben Attar, and his Arabian
horse, Sidi Habismilk, both of which were to astonish the natives
of the Suffolk broads.&nbsp; The party reached London on 16th
April and stayed at the Spread Eagle Inn, Gracechurch
Street.&nbsp; The marriage took place at St. Peter&rsquo;s
Church, Cornhill, on 23rd April, 1840.</p>
<p>There are only two letters from Mrs. Borrow to her husband
extant.&nbsp; They were written in the Hereford Square days
between the years 1860 and 1869&mdash;the last year of Mrs.
Borrow&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The pair had been married some
twenty-five years at least, and it is made clear by those letters
alone that at the end of this period they were still a most
happily assorted couple.&nbsp; Mrs. Borrow must have gone to
Brighton for her health on two separate occasions, each time
accompanied by her daughter.&nbsp; Borrow, who had enjoyed many a
pleasant ramble on his own account, as we shall see&mdash;rambles
which extended as far away as Constantinople&mdash;is <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&ldquo;keeping house&rdquo; in Hereford Square,
Brompton, the while.&nbsp; It will be noted that Mrs. Borrow
signed herself &ldquo;Carreta,&rdquo; the pet name that her
husband always gave her.&nbsp; It has been suggested that as
&ldquo;carreta&rdquo; means a Spanish dray-cart,
&ldquo;carita,&rdquo; &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo; was probably
meant.&nbsp; But, careless as was the famous word-master over the
spelling of words in the tongues that he never really mastered
scientifically, he could scarcely have made so obvious a blunder
as this, and there must have been some particular experience in
the lives of husband and wife that led to the playful
designation. <a name="citation145a"></a><a href="#footnote145a"

<p>No reader can peruse the following pages without recognising
the true affection for his wife that is transparent in
Borrow&rsquo;s letters to her.&nbsp; Arthur Dalrymple&rsquo;s
remark that he had frequently seen Borrow and his wife
travelling&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He stalking along with a huge cloak wrapped round
him in all weathers, and she trudging behind him like an Indian
squaw, with a carpet bag, or bundle, or small portmanteau in her
arms, and endeavouring under difficulty to keep up with his
enormous strides&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is clearly a travesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Borrow was devoted to
her husband, and looked after business matters; and he always
treated her with exceeding kindness,&rdquo; is the verdict of
Miss Elizabeth Jay, who was frequently privileged to visit the
husband and wife at Oulton.</p>

147</span>CHAPTER XX<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Children of the Open
Air</span>&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Behold</span> George Borrow, then, in a
comfortable home on the banks of Oulton Broad&mdash;a family
man.&nbsp; His mother&mdash;sensible woman&mdash;declines her
son&rsquo;s invitation to live with the newly-married pair.&nbsp;
She remains in the cottage at Norwich where her husband
died.&nbsp; The Borrows were married in April, 1840, by May they
had settled at Oulton.&nbsp; It was a pleasantly secluded estate,
and Borrow&rsquo;s wife had &pound;450 a year.&nbsp; He had, a
month before his marriage, written to Mr. Brandram to say that he
had a work nearly ready for publication, and &ldquo;two others in
a state of forwardness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The title of the first of
these books he enclosed in his letter.&nbsp; It was <i>The
Zincali</i>: <i>Or an Account of the Gypsies of Spain</i>.&nbsp;
Mr. Samuel Smiles, in his history of the House of
Murray&mdash;<i>A Publisher and his Friends</i>&mdash;thus
relates the circumstances of its publication:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>In November 1840 a tall, athletic gentleman in
black called upon Mr. Murray offering a MS. for perusal and
publication. . . .&nbsp; Mr. Murray could not fail to be taken at
first sight with this extraordinary man.&nbsp; He had a splendid
physique, standing six feet two in his stockings, and he had
brains as well as muscles, as his works sufficiently show.&nbsp;
The book now submitted was of a very uncommon character, and
neither the author nor the publisher were very sanguine about its
success.&nbsp; Mr. Murray agreed, after perusal, to print and
publish 750 copies of <i>The Gypsies in Spain</i>, and divide the
profits with the author.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was at the suggestion of Richard Ford, then the greatest
living English authority on Spain, that Mr. Murray published the
book.&nbsp; It did not really commence to sell until <i>The Bible
in Spain</i> came a year or so later to bring the author
reputation.&nbsp; From November, 1840, to June, 1841, only three
hundred copies had been sold in spite of friendly reviews in some
half-dozen journals, including <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> and
<i>The Literary Gazette</i>.&nbsp; The first edition, it may be
mentioned, contained on its title-page a description of the
author as <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>&ldquo;late agent of the British and Foreign Bible
Society in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is very marked compression
in the edition now in circulation, and a perusal of the first
edition reveals many interesting features that deserve to be
restored for the benefit of the curious.&nbsp; But nothing can
make <i>The Zincali</i> a great piece of literature.&nbsp; It was
summarised by the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> at the time as &ldquo;a
hotch-potch of the jockey, tramper, philologist, and
missionary.&rdquo;&nbsp; That description, which was not intended
to be as flattering as it sounds to-day, appears more to apply to
<i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; But <i>The Zincali</i> is too
confused, too ill-arranged a book to rank with Borrow&rsquo;s
four great works.&nbsp; There are passages in it, indeed, so
eloquent, so romantic, that no lover of Borrow&rsquo;s writings
can afford to neglect them.&nbsp; But this was not the book that
gypsy-loving Borrow, with the temperament of a Romany, should
have written, or could have written had he not been obsessed by
the &ldquo;science&rdquo; of his subject.&nbsp; His real work in
gypsydom was to appear later in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; For Borrow was not a man of science&mdash;a
philologist, a folk-lorist of the first order.</p>
<p>No one, indeed, who had read only <i>The Zincali</i> among
Borrow&rsquo;s works could see in it any suspicion of the writer
who was for all time to throw a glamour over the gypsy, to make
the &ldquo;children of the open air&rdquo; a veritable cult, to
earn for him the title of &ldquo;the walking lord of gypsy
lore,&rdquo; and to lay the foundations of an admirable
succession of books both in fact and fiction&mdash;but not one as
great as his own.&nbsp; It is clear that the city of Seville,
with sarcastic letters from Bible Society secretaries on one
side, and some manner of love romance on the other, was not so
good a place for an author to produce a real book as Oulton was
to become.&nbsp; Richard Ford&rsquo;s judgment was sound when he
said with quite wonderful prescience:</p>
<blockquote><p>How I wish you had given us more about yourself,
instead of the extracts from those blunder-headed old Spaniards,
who knew nothing about gypsies!&nbsp; I shall give you the
<i>rap</i>, on that, and a hint to publish your whole adventures
for the last twenty years. <a name="citation148"></a><a
href="#footnote148" class="citation">[148]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henceforth Borrow was to write about himself and to <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>become a
great author in consequence.&nbsp; For in writing about himself
as in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i> he was to write
exactly as he felt about the gypsies, and to throw over them the
glamour of his own point of view, the view of a man who loved the
broad highway and those who sojourned upon it.&nbsp; In <i>The
Gypsies of Spain</i> we have a conventional estimate of the
gypsies.&nbsp; &ldquo;There can be no doubt that they are human
beings and have immortal souls,&rdquo; he says, even as if he
were writing a letter to the Bible Society.&nbsp; All his
anecdotes about the gypsies are unfavourable to them, suggestive
only of them as knaves and cheats.&nbsp; From these pictures it
is a far cry to the creation of Jasper Petulengro and Isopel
Berners.&nbsp; The most noteworthy figure in <i>The Zincali</i>
is the gypsy soldier of Valdepenas, an unholy rascal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To lie, to steal, to shed human blood&rdquo;&mdash;these
are the most marked characteristics with which Borrow endows the
gypsies of Spain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Abject and vile as they have ever
been, the git&aacute;nos have nevertheless found admirers in
Spain,&rdquo; says the author who came to be popularly recognised
as the most enthusiastic admirer of the gypsies in Spain and
elsewhere.&nbsp; Read to-day by the lover of Borrow&rsquo;s other
books <i>The Zincali</i> will be pronounced a readable collection
of anecdotes, interspersed with much dull matter, with here and
there a piece of admirable writing.&nbsp; But the book would
scarcely have lived had it not been followed by four works of so
fine an individuality.&nbsp; Well might Ford ask Borrow for more
about himself and less of the extracts from &ldquo;blunder-headed
old Spaniards.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Borrow came to write about
himself he revealed his real kindness for the gypsy folk.&nbsp;
He gave us Jasper Petulengro and the incomparable description of
&ldquo;the wind on the heath.&rdquo;&nbsp; He kindled the
imagination of men, proclaimed the joys of vagabondage in a
manner that thrilled many hearts.&nbsp; He had some predecessors
and many successors, but &ldquo;none could then, or can ever
again,&rdquo; says the biographer of a later Rye, &ldquo;see or
hear of Romanies without thinking of Borrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; In her
biography of one of these successors in gypsy lore, Charles
Godfrey Leland, Mrs. Pennell discusses the probability that
Borrow and Leland met in the British Museum.&nbsp; That is
admitted in a letter from Leland to Borrow in my
possession.&nbsp; To this letter Borrow made no reply.&nbsp; It
was wrong of him.&nbsp; But he was then&mdash;in 1873&mdash;a
prematurely <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>old man, worn out and saddened by neglect and a sense
of literary failure.&nbsp; For this and for the other vagaries of
those latter years Borrow will not be judged harshly by those who
read his story here.&nbsp; Nothing could be more courteous than
Borrow&rsquo;s one letter to Leland, written in the failing
handwriting&mdash;once so excellent&mdash;of the last sad decade
of his life:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">22 <span
class="smcap">Hereford Square</span>, <span
class="smcap">Brompton</span>, <i>Nov.</i> 2, 1871.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received your
letter and am gratified by the desire you express to make my
acquaintance.&nbsp; Whenever you please to come I shall be happy
to see you.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meeting did not, through Leland&rsquo;s absence from
London, then take place.&nbsp; Two years later it was another
story.&nbsp; The failing powers were more noteworthy.&nbsp;
Borrow was by this time dead to the world, as the documents
before me abundantly testify.&nbsp; It is not, therefore,
necessary to assume, as Leland&rsquo;s friends have done, that
Borrow never replied because he was on the eve of publishing a
book of his own about the gypsies.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Langham
Hotel</span>, <span class="smcap">Portland Place</span>,
<i>March</i> 31<i>st</i>, 1873.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I sincerely trust
that the limited extent of our acquaintanceship will not cause
this note to seem to you too presuming.&nbsp; <i>Breviter</i>, I
have thrown the results of my observations among English gypsies
into a very unpretending little volume consisting almost entirely
of facts gathered from the Romany, without any theory.&nbsp; As I
owe all my interest in the subject to your writings, and as I am
sincerely grateful to you for the impulse which they gave me, I
should like very much to dedicate my book to you.&nbsp; Of course
if your kindness permits I shall submit the proofs to you, that
you may judge whether the work deserves the honour.&nbsp; I
should have sent you the MS., but not long after our meeting at
the British Museum I left for Egypt, whence I have very recently
returned, to find my publisher clamorous for the promised
copy.</p>
<p>It is <i>not</i>&mdash;God knows&mdash;a mean and selfish
desire to help my book by giving it the authority of your name,
which induces this request.&nbsp; But I am earnestly desirous for
my conscience&rsquo; sake to publish nothing in the Romany which
shall not be true and sensible, even as all that you have written
is true and sensible.&nbsp; Therefore, <i>should</i> you take the
pains to glance over my proof, I <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>should be grateful if you would
signify to me any differences of opinion should there be ground
for any.&nbsp; Dr. A. F. Pott in his <i>Zigeuner</i> (vol. ii. p.
224), intimates very decidedly that you took the word
<i>shastr</i> (Exhastra de Moyses) from Sanskrit and put it into
Romany; declaring that it would be very important if
<i>shaster</i> were Romany.&nbsp; I mention in my book that
English gypsies call the New Testament (also any MS.) a
<i>shaster</i>, and that a betting-book on a racecourse is called
a <i>shaster</i> &ldquo;because it is written.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do
not pretend in my book to such deep Romany as you have
achieved&mdash;all that I claim is to have collected certain
words, facts, phrases, etc., out of the Romany of the
roads&mdash;corrupt as it is&mdash;as I have found it
to-day.&nbsp; I deal only with the gypsy of the
<i>Decadence</i>.&nbsp; With renewed apology for intrusion should
it seem such, I remain, yours very respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Charles G.

</blockquote>
<p>Francis Hindes Groome remarked when reviewing Borrow&rsquo;s
<i>Word Book</i> in 1874, <a name="citation151"></a><a
href="#footnote151" class="citation">[151]</a> that when <i>The
Gypsies of Spain</i> was published in 1841 &ldquo;there were not
two educated men in England who possessed the slightest knowledge
of Romany.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the intervening thirty-three years all
this was changed.&nbsp; There was an army of gypsy scholars or
scholar gypsies of whom Leland was one, Hindes Groome another,
and Professor E. H. Palmer a third, to say nothing of many
scholars and students of Romany in other lands.&nbsp; Not one of
them seemed when Borrow published his <i>Word Book of the
Romany</i> to see that he was the only man of genius among
them.&nbsp; They only saw that he was an inferior philologist to
them all.&nbsp; And so Borrow, who prided himself on things that
he could do indifferently quite as much as upon things that he
could do well, suffered once again, as he was so often doomed to
suffer, for the lack of appreciation which was all in all to him,
and his career went out in a veritable blizzard.&nbsp; He
published nothing after his <i>Romano Lavo-Lil</i> appeared in
1874.&nbsp; He was then indeed a broken and a bitter man, with no
further interest in life.&nbsp; Dedications of books to him
interested him not at all.&nbsp; In any other mood, or a few
years earlier, Leland&rsquo;s book, <i>The English Gypsies</i>,
would have gladdened his heart.&nbsp; In his preface Leland
expresses &ldquo;the highest respect for the labours of Mr.
George Borrow in this field,&rdquo; he quotes Borrow continually
and with sympathy, and renders him honour as a philologist that
has usually been withheld.&nbsp; &ldquo;To Mr. Borrow is due <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the
discovery that the word <i>jockey</i> is of gypsy origin and
derived from <i>chuckiri</i>, which means a whip,&rdquo; and he
credits Borrow with the discovery of the origin of
&ldquo;tanner&rdquo; for sixpence; he vindicates him as against
Dr. A. F. Pott&mdash;a prince among students of gypsydom&mdash;of
being the first to discover that the English gypsies call the
Bible the <i>shaster</i>.&nbsp; But there is a wealth of
scientific detail in Leland&rsquo;s books that is not to be found
in Borrow&rsquo;s, as also there is in Francis Hindes
Groome&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; What had Borrow to do with
science?&nbsp; He could not even give the word
&ldquo;R&uacute;mani&rdquo; its accent, and called it
&ldquo;Romany.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;quietly
appropriated,&rdquo; says Groome, &ldquo;Bright&rsquo;s Spanish
gypsy words for his own work, mistakes and all, without one word
of recognition.&nbsp; I think one has the ancient impostor
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;His knowledge of the strange history
of the gypsies was very elementary, of their manners almost more
so, and of their folk-lore practically <i>nil</i>,&rdquo; says
Groome elsewhere.&nbsp; Yet Mr. Hindes Groome readily
acknowledges that Borrow is above all writers on the
gypsies.&nbsp; &ldquo;He communicates a subtle insight into
gypsydom&rdquo;&mdash;that is the very essence of the
matter.&nbsp; Controversy will continue in the future as in the
present as to whether the gypsies are all that Borrow thought
them.&nbsp; Perhaps &ldquo;corruption has crept in among
them&rdquo; as it did with the prize-fighters.&nbsp; They have
intermarried with the gorgios, thrown over their ancient customs,
lost all their picturesque qualities, it may be.&nbsp; But Borrow
has preserved in literature for all time, as not one of the
philologists and folk-lore students has done, a remarkable type
of people.&nbsp; But this is not to be found in his first
original work, <i>The Zincali</i>, nor in his last, <i>The Romano
Lavo-Lil</i>.&nbsp; This glamour is to be found in
<i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i>, to which books we
shall come in due course.&nbsp; Here we need only refer to the
fact that Borrow had loved the gypsies all his life&mdash;from
his boyish meeting with Petulengro until in advancing years the
prototype of that wonderful creation of his imagination&mdash;for
this the Petulengro of <i>Lavengro</i> undoubtedly was&mdash;came
to visit him at Oulton.&nbsp; Well might Leland call him
&ldquo;the Nestor of Gypsydom.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>CHAPTER XXI<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Bible in Spain</span>&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> an admirable appreciation of our
author, the one in which he gives the oft-quoted eulogy
concerning him as &ldquo;the delightful, the bewitching, the
never-sufficiently-to-be-praised George Borrow,&rdquo; Mr.
Birrell records the solace that may be found by small boys in the
ambiguities of a title-page, or at least might have been found in
it in his youth and in mine.&nbsp; In those days in certain
Puritan circles a very strong line was drawn between what was
known as Sunday reading, and reading that might be permitted on
week-days.&nbsp; The Sunday book must have a religious
flavour.&nbsp; There were magazines with that particular flavour,
every story in them having a pious moral withal.&nbsp; Very
closely watched and scrutinised was the reading of young people
in those days and in those circles.&nbsp; Mr. Birrell, doubtless,
speaks from autobiographical memories when he tells us of a small
boy with whose friends <i>The Bible in Spain</i> passed muster on
the strength of its title-page.&nbsp; For Mr. Birrell is the son
of a venerated Nonconformist minister; and perhaps he, or at
least those who were of his household, had this religious
idiosyncrasy.&nbsp; It may be that the distinction which pervaded
the evangelical circles of Mr. Birrell&rsquo;s youth as to what
were Sunday books, as distinct from books to be read on
week-days, has disappeared.&nbsp; In any case think of the
advantage of the boy of that generation who was able to handle a
book with so unexceptionable a title as <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>.&nbsp; His elders would succumb at once, particularly
if the boy had the good sense to call their attention to the
sub-title&mdash;&ldquo;The Journeys, Adventures, and
Imprisonments of an Englishman in an Attempt to Circulate the
Scriptures in the Peninsula.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing could be said
by the most devout of seniors against so prepossessing a
title-page.&nbsp; But what of the boy who had thus passed the
censorship?&nbsp; What a revelation of adventure <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>was open to
him.&nbsp; Perhaps he would skip the &ldquo;preachy&rdquo; parts
in which Borrow was doubtless sincere, although the sincerity has
so uncertain a ring to-day.&nbsp; Here are five passages, for
example, which do not seem to belong to the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>In whatever part of the world I, a poor wanderer
in the Gospel&rsquo;s cause, may chance to be</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>very possibly the fate of St. Stephen might overtake me; but
does the man deserve the name of a follower of Christ who would
shrink from danger of any kind in the cause of Him whom he calls
his Master?&nbsp; &ldquo;He who loses his life for my sake shall
find it,&rdquo; are words which the Lord Himself uttered.&nbsp;
These words were fraught with consolation to me, as they
doubtless are to every one engaged in propagating the Gospel, in
sincerity of heart, in savage and barbarian lands.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Unhappy land! not until the pure light of the Gospel has
illumined thee, wilt thou learn that the greatest of all gifts is
charity!</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>and I thought that to convey the Gospel to a place so wild and
remote might perhaps be considered an acceptable pilgrimage in
the eyes of my Maker.&nbsp; True it is that but one copy remained
of those which I had brought with me on this last journey; but
this reflection, far from discouraging me in my projected
enterprise, produced the contrary effect, as I called to mind
that, ever since the Lord revealed Himself to man, it has seemed
good to Him to accomplish the greatest ends by apparently the
most insufficient means; and I reflected that this one copy might
serve as an instrument for more good than the four thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine copies of the edition of Madrid.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I shall not detain the course of my narrative with reflections
as to the state of a Church which, though it pretends to be
founded on scripture, would yet keep the light of scripture from
all mankind, if possible.&nbsp; But Rome is fully aware that she
is not a Christian Church, and having no desire to become so, she
acts prudently in keeping from the eyes of her followers the page
which would reveal to them the truths of Christianity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this does not ring quite true, and in any case it is too
much on the lines of &ldquo;Sunday reading&rdquo; to please the
small boy, who must, however, have found a thousand things in
that volume that were to his taste&mdash;some of the wildest <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>adventures,
hairbreadth escapes, extraordinary meetings again and again with
unique people&mdash;with Benedict Mol, for example, who was
always seeking for treasure.&nbsp; Gypsies, bull-fighters, quaint
and queer characters of every kind, come before us in rapid
succession.&nbsp; Rarely, surely, have so many adventures been
crowded into the same number of pages.&nbsp; Only when Borrow
remembers, as he has to do occasionally, that he is an agent of
the Bible Society does the book lose its vigour and its
charm.&nbsp; We have already pointed out that the foundations of
the volume were contained in certain letters written by Borrow
during his five years in Spain to the secretaries of the Bible
Society in London.&nbsp; The recent publication of these letters
has revealed to us Borrow&rsquo;s methods.&nbsp; When he had
settled down at Oulton he took down his notebooks, one of which
is before me, but finding this was not sufficient, he asked the
Bible Society for the loan of his letters to them.&nbsp; Other
letters that he hoped to use were not forthcoming, as the
following note from Miss Gurney to Mrs. Borrow indicates:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. George Borrow</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Earlham</span>,
12<i>th</i> <i>June</i>, 1840.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Borrow</span>,&mdash;I am sorry
I cannot find any of Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s letters from Spain.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t think we ever had any, but my brother is from home
and I therefore cannot inquire of him.</p>
<p>I send you the only two I can find.&nbsp; I am very glad he is
going to publish his travels, which I have no doubt will be very
interesting.&nbsp; It must be a pleasant object to assist him by
copying the manuscripts.&nbsp; If I should visit Lowestoft this
summer I shall hope to see you, but I have no immediate prospect
of doing so.&nbsp; With kind regards to all your party, I am,
Dear Mrs. Borrow, Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">C.
Gurney</span>. <a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible Society, applied to in the same manner, lent Borrow
all his letters to that organisation and its secretaries.</p>
<p>Not all were returned.&nbsp; Many came to Dr. Knapp when he
purchased the half of the Borrow papers that were sold after
Borrow&rsquo;s death; the remainder are in my possession.</p>
<p>It is a nice point, seventy years after they were written, <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>as to whom
they belong.&nbsp; In any case the Bible Society must have kept
copies of everything, for when, in 1911, they came to publish the
<i>Letters</i> the collection was sufficiently complete.&nbsp;
That publication revealed some interesting sidelights.&nbsp; It
proved on the one hand that Borrow had drawn more upon his
diaries than upon his letters, although he frequently reproduced
fragments of his diaries in his letters.&nbsp; It revealed
further the extraordinary frankness with which Borrow wrote to
his employers.&nbsp; It is true that it further reveals the
manner in which he throws a sop of godliness to the worthy
secretaries.&nbsp; But the main point is in the discovery
revealed to us that Borrow was not an artist in his
letters.&nbsp; Borrow was never a good letter writer, although I
think that many of the letters that appear for the first time in
these pages will prove that his letters are very interesting as
contributions to biography.&nbsp; If some of the letters that
helped to make up <i>The Bible in Spain</i> are interesting, it
is because in them Borrow incorporated considerable fragments of
anecdote and adventure from his note-books.&nbsp; It is quite a
mistake to assume, as does Dr. Knapp, that the &ldquo;Rev. and
Dear Sir&rdquo; at the head of a letter was the only
variation.&nbsp; You will look in vain in the Bible Society
correspondence for many a pearl that is contained in <i>The Bible
in Spain</i>, and happily you will look in vain in <i>The Bible
in Spain</i> for many an unctuous sentence which concludes some
of the original letters.&nbsp; In one case, indeed, a letter
concludes with Heber&rsquo;s hymn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s Icy
Mountains,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with which Borrow&rsquo;s correspondent must already have been
sufficiently familiar.&nbsp; But Borrow could not be other than
Borrow, and the secretaries of the Bible Society had plentiful
matter with which to astonish them.&nbsp; The finished
production, however, is a fascinating book.&nbsp; You read it
again and it becomes still more entertaining.&nbsp; No wonder
that it took the world by storm and made its author the lion of a
season.&nbsp; &ldquo;A queer book will be this same <i>Bible in
Spain</i>,&rdquo; wrote Borrow to John Murray in August, 1841,
&ldquo;containing all my queer adventures in that queer country .
. . it will make two nice foolscap octavo volumes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It actually made three volumes, and Borrow was as irritated at
Mr. Murray&rsquo;s delay in publishing as that publisher
afterwards <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>became at Borrow&rsquo;s own delay over
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; The whole book was laboriously copied out
by Mrs. Borrow.&nbsp; When this copy was sent to Mr. Murray, it
was submitted to his &ldquo;reader,&rdquo; who reported
&ldquo;numerous faults in spelling and some in grammar,&rdquo; to
which criticism Borrow retorted that the copy was the work of
&ldquo;a country amanuensis.&rdquo;&nbsp; The book was published
in December, 1842, but has the date 1843 on its title-page.&nbsp;
In its three-volumed form 4750 copies of the book were issued by
July, 1843, after which countless copies were sold in cheaper
one-volumed form.&nbsp; Success had at last come to Borrow.&nbsp;
He was one of the most talked-of writers of the day.&nbsp; His
elation may be demonstrated by his discussion with Dawson Turner
as to whether he should leave the manuscript of <i>The Bible in
Spain</i> to the Dean and Chapter&rsquo;s Library at Norwich or
to the British Museum, by his gratification at the fact that Sir
Robert Peel referred to his book in the House of Commons, and by
his pleasure in the many appreciative reviews which, indeed, were
for the most part all that an ambitious author could
desire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said <i>The Examiner</i>,
&ldquo;was book more legibly impressed with the unmistakable mark
of genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no taking leave of a book
like this,&rdquo; said the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Better Christmas fare we have never had it in our power to
offer our readers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publication of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> made Borrow
famous for a time.&nbsp; Hitherto he had been known only to a
small religious community, the coterie that ran the Bible
Society.&nbsp; Even the large mass of people who subscribed to
that Society knew its agent in Spain only by meagre allusions in
the Annual Reports.&nbsp; Now the world was to talk about him,
and he enjoyed being talked about.&nbsp; Borrow declared&mdash;in
1842&mdash;that the five years he passed in Spain were the most
happy years of his existence.&nbsp; But then he had not had a
happy life during the previous years, as we have seen, and in
Russia he had a toilsome task with an added element of
uncertainty as to the permanence of his position.&nbsp; The five
years in Spain had plentiful adventure, and they closed in a
pleasant manner.&nbsp; Yet the year that followed, even though it
found him almost a country squire, was not a happy one.&nbsp;
Once again the world did not want him and his books&mdash;not the
<i>Gypsies of Spain</i> for example.&nbsp; Seven weeks after
publication it had sold only to the extent of <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>some three
hundred copies.&nbsp; But the happiest year of Borrow&rsquo;s
life was undoubtedly the one that followed the publication of
<i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; Up to that time he had been a
mere adventurer; now he was that most joyous of beings&mdash;a
successful author; and here, from among his Papers, is a
carefully preserved relic of his social triumph:</p>

night at the Bishop of Norwich&rsquo;s, but arrived there too
late.&nbsp; They had already commissioned Lady Hall (sister to
Madam Bunsen) to express to Mr. Borrow their wish for his
acquaintance.</p>
<p>In a letter to his wife he writes of this visit to the
Prussian Minister, where he had for company &ldquo;Princes and
Members of Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was the star of the

powers as a linguist, and for the originality of his character,

laughing a good part of breakfast time by the oddity of his
remarks, as well as the positiveness of his assertions, often
rather startling, and, like his books, partaking of the

<p>The earliest literary efforts of Borrow in Spain were his two
translations of St. Luke&rsquo;s Gospel&mdash;the one into
Romany, the other into Basque.&nbsp; This last book he did not
actually translate himself, but procured &ldquo;from a Basque
physician of the name of Oteiza.&rdquo;</p>

160</span>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smcap">Richard Ford</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most distinguished of
Borrow&rsquo;s friends in the years that succeeded his return
from Spain was Richard Ford, whose interests were so largely
wrapped up in the story of that country.&nbsp; Ford was possessed
of a very interesting personality, which was not revealed to the
public until Mr. Rowland E. Prothero issued his excellent
biography in 1905, although Ford died in 1858.&nbsp; This delay
is the more astonishing as Ford&rsquo;s <i>Handbook for
Travellers in Spain</i> was one of the most famous books of its
day.&nbsp; Ford&rsquo;s father, Sir Richard Ford, was a friend of
William Pitt, and twice sat in Parliament, being at one time
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department.&nbsp; He ended
his official career as a police magistrate at Bow Street, but
deserves to be better known to fame as the creator of the mounted
police force of London.&nbsp; Ford was born with a silver spoon
in his mouth, inheriting a fortune from his father, and from his
mother an extraordinary taste for art.&nbsp; Although called to
the Bar he never practised, but spent his time in travelling on
the Continent, building up a valuable collection of books and
paintings.&nbsp; He was three times married, and all these unions
seem to have been happy, in spite of an almost unpleasant
celerity in the second alliance, which took place nine months
after the death of his first wife.&nbsp; A very large portion of
his life he devoted to Spain, which he knew so intimately that in
1845 he produced that remarkable <i>Handbook</i> in two closely
printed volumes, a most repellent-looking book in appearance to
those who are used to contemporary typography, usually so
attractive.&nbsp; Ford, in fact, was so full of his subject that
instead of a handbook he wrote a work which ought to have
appeared in half a dozen volumes.&nbsp; In later editions the
book was condensed into one of Mr. Murray&rsquo;s usual
guide-books, but the curious may still enjoy the work in its
earliest form, so rich in discussions of the <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Spanish
people, their art and architecture, their history and their
habits.&nbsp; The greater part of the letters in Mr.
Prothero&rsquo;s collection are addressed to Addington, who was
our ambassador to Madrid for some years, until he was superseded
by George Villiers, Lord Clarendon, with whom Borrow came so much
in contact.&nbsp; Those letters reveal a remarkably cultivated
mind and an interesting outlook on life, an outlook that was
always intensely anti-democratic.&nbsp; It is impossible to
sympathise with him in his brutal reference to the execution by
the Spaniards of Robert Boyd, a young Irishman who was captured
with Torrijos by the Spanish Government in 1831.&nbsp; Richard
Ford apparently left Spain very shortly before George Borrow
entered that country.&nbsp; Ford passed through Madrid on his way
to England in September, 1833.&nbsp; He then settled near Exeter,
purchasing an Elizabethan cottage called Heavitree House, with
twelve acres of land, and devoted himself to turning it into a
beautiful mansion.&nbsp; Presumably he first met Borrow in Mr.
John Murray&rsquo;s famous drawing-room soon after the
publication of <i>The Gypsies in Spain</i>.&nbsp; He tells
Addington, indeed, in a letter of 14th January, 1841:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have made acquaintance with an extraordinary
fellow, George Borrow, who went out to Spain to convert the
gypsies.&nbsp; He is about to publish his failure, and a curious
book it will be.&nbsp; It was submitted to my perusal by the
hesitating Murray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ford&rsquo;s article upon Borrow&rsquo;s book appeared in
<i>The British and Foreign Review</i>, and Ford was delighted
that the book had created a sensation, and that he had given
sound advice as to publishing the manuscript.&nbsp; When <i>The
Bible in Spain</i> was ready, Ford was one of the first to read
it.&nbsp; Then he wrote to John Murray:</p>
<blockquote><p>I read Borrow with great delight all the way down
per rail.&nbsp; You may depend upon it that the book will sell,
which after all is the rub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in that letter Ford describes the book as putting him in
mind of <i>Gil Blas</i> with &ldquo;a touch of
Bunyan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lockhart himself reviewed the book in <i>The
Quarterly</i>, so Ford had to go to the rival organ&mdash;<i>The
Edinburgh Review</i>&mdash;receiving &pound;44 for the article,
which sum, he tells us, he invested in Ch&acirc;teau Margaux.</p>

written in Spanish, but I content myself with giving only a
translation:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I was glad to
hear from you of the successful termination of your literary
work.&nbsp; Fancy those rogues of Zincali!&nbsp; They have
managed to make good money&mdash;I always thought Messrs. M. very
decent people, it usually happens that those who have much to do
with good class of people become themselves somewhat large-minded
and liberal.&nbsp; You must admit that I am a model critic, and
that I cry, &ldquo;Luck to the Books.&rdquo;&nbsp; Full well do I
know how you thank the most noble and illustrious public!&nbsp;
Go ahead, therefore, and leave nothing forgotten in the ink-pot;
but by all that is holy, shun the Spanish historians, who are
liars and fools!&nbsp; I regret very much that you should have
left London; I leave here on Saturday with the intention of
paying a visit of about three weeks to the maternal home, as is
my custom in the month of the Christmas boxes.&nbsp; Very much
would I have liked to see you and discuss with you about things
of Spain and other gypsy lore and fancy topics, but of which at
present nothing do I understand.&nbsp; I shall not fail to take
with me the papers and documents which you kindly sent me to
Cheltenham.&nbsp; I will make them into a parcel and leave them
with Messrs. Murray, so that you can send for them whenever you
like.&nbsp; I shall do my best to penetrate those mysteries and
that strange people.&nbsp; Mr. Murray, junior, writes in a
pleased tone respecting <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; I should
like to write an article on a subject so full of interest.&nbsp;
Possibly my article on the gypsies will appear in the next
number, and in such case it will prove more useful to you than if
it appeared now.&nbsp; The life and memory of reviews are very
short.&nbsp; They appear like butterflies, and die in a
day.&nbsp; The dead and the departed have no friends.&nbsp; The
living to the feast, the dead to the grave.&nbsp; No sooner does
a new number appear than the last one is already forgotten and
joins the things of the past.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; At a
party recently in which a drawing was held, I drew the <i>Krallis
de los Zincali</i>.&nbsp; I beg to enclose the table (or index)
for your Majesty&rsquo;s guidance; really, I must have in my
veins a few drops of the genuine wanderer.&nbsp; Mr. Gagargos has
been just appointed Spanish Consul in Tunis, where he will not
lack means for progressing in the Arabic language and
literature.&mdash;Yours, in all friendliness,</p>

<p>Here is a second letter of the following month:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>February</i>
26<i>th</i>, <span class="smcap">Heavitree House</span>, <span
class="smcap">Exeter</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Batuschca Borrow</span>,&mdash;I am glad
that the paper pleased you, and I think it calculated to promote
the sale, which a too copious <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>extracting article does not always
do, as people think that they have had the cream.&nbsp; Napier
sent me &pound;44 for the thirty-two pages; this, with
Kemble&rsquo;s &pound;50, 8s. for the <i>Zincali</i>, nearly
reaches &pound;100: I lay it out in claret, being not amiss to do
in the world, and richer by many hundreds a year than last year,
but with a son at Eton and daughters coming out, and an overgrown
set of servants, money is never to be despised, and I find that
expenditure by some infernal principle has a greater tendency to
increase than income, and that when the latter increases it never
does so in the ratio of the former&mdash;enough of that.&nbsp;
How to write an article without being
condensed&mdash;epigrammatical and <i>epitomical cream-skimming
that is</i>&mdash;I know not, one has so much to say and so
little space to say it in.</p>
<p>I rejoice to hear of your meditated biography; really I am
your wet nurse, and you ought to dedicate it to me; take time,
but not too much; avoid, all attempts to write fine; just dash
down the first genuine uppouring idea and thoughts in the
plainest language and that which comes first, and then fine it
and compress it.&nbsp; Let us have a glossary; for people cry out
for a Dragoman, and half your local gusto evaporates.</p>
<p>I am amazed at the want of profits&mdash;&rsquo;tis sad to
think what meagre profits spring from pen and ink; but Cervantes
died a beggar and is immortal.&nbsp; It is the devil who comes
into the market with ready money: <i>No</i> solvendum in futuro:
I well know that it is cash down which makes the mare to go;
dollars will add spurs even to the Prince of Mustard&rsquo;s
paces.</p>
<p>It is a bore not receiving even the crumbs which drop from
such tables as those spread by Mr. Eyre: Murray, however, is a
deep cove, <i>y muy pratico en cosas de libreteria</i>: and he
knew that the <i>first out</i> about Afghan would sell
prodigiously.&nbsp; I doubt now if Lady Sale would now be such a
general Sale.&nbsp; Murray builds solid castles in Eyre.&nbsp;
Los de Espa&ntilde;a rezalo bene de ser siempre muy Cosas de

Arriba! no dejei nada en el tintero; basta que sea nuevo y muy

<p>I had nothing to do whatever with the <i>manner</i> in which
the handbook puff was affixed to your book.&nbsp; I wrote the
said paper, but concluded that Murray would put it, as usual, in
the flyleaf of the book, as he does in his others, and the <i>Q.

<p>During these years&mdash;1843 and onwards&mdash;Borrow was
regularly corresponding with Ford, as we learn from Ford&rsquo;s
own words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Borrow writes me word that his Life is nearly
ready, and it will run the Bible hull down.&nbsp; If he tells
truth it will be a queer thing.&nbsp; I shall review it for
<i>The Edinburgh</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To George

<p><span class="smcap">Batuschca B.</span>,&mdash;Knowing that

very handsomely of your labour.&nbsp; Such a public testimonial
is a good puff, and I hope will attract
purchasers.&mdash;Sincerely yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">R. F.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to a speech of Peel&rsquo;s in the House of
Commons, in which in reply to a very trivial question by Dr.
Bowring, then M.P. for Bolton, upon the subject of the
correspondence of the British Government with Turkey, the great
statesman urged:</p>
<blockquote><p>It might have been said to Mr. Borrow, with
respect to Spain, that it would be impossible to distribute the
Bible in that country in consequence of the danger of offending
the prejudices which prevail there; yet he, a private individual,
by showing some zeal in what he believed to be right, succeeded
in triumphing over many obstacles. <a name="citation164"></a><a
href="#footnote164" class="citation">[164]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow was elated with the compliment, and asked Mr. Murray
two months later if he could not advertise the eulogium with one
of his books.</p>
<p>In June, 1844, while the <i>Handbook for Travellers in
Spain</i> was going to press, Ford went on a visit to Borrow at
Oulton Hall, and describes the pair as &ldquo;two rum coves in a
queer country&rdquo;; and further gives one of the best
descriptions of the place:</p>
<blockquote><p>His house hangs over a lonely lake covered with
wild fowl, and is girt with dark firs through which the wind
sighs sadly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the <i>Handbook for Travellers in Spain</i> was published
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>in 1845
it was agreed that Borrow should write the review for <i>The
Quarterly</i>.&nbsp; Instead of writing a review Borrow,
possessed by that tactlessness which so frequently overcame him,
wrote an article on &ldquo;Spain and the Spaniards,&rdquo; very
largely of abuse, an absolutely useless production from the point
of view of Ford the author, and of Lockhart, his editor
friend.&nbsp; Borrow never forgave Lockhart for returning this
manuscript, but that it had no effect on Ford&rsquo;s friendship
is shown by the letter on p. 167, dated 1846, written long after
the unfortunate episode, and another in Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s
<i>Life</i>, dated 1851.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Oulton Hall</span>, <span

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Oct.</i> 6, 1844, <span

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;I trouble you
with a line to say that I have received a letter from Don Jorge,
from Constantinople.&nbsp; He evidently is now anxious to be
quietly back again on the banks of your peaceful lake; he speaks
favourably of his health, which has been braced up by change of
air, scenery, and occupations, so I hope he will get through next
winter without any bronchitis, and go on with his own
biography.</p>
<p>He asks me when <i>Handbook</i> will be done?&nbsp; Please to
tell him that it is done and printing, but that it runs double
the length which was contemplated: however, it will be a
<i>queer</i> book, and tell him that we reserve it until his
return to <i>review</i> it.&nbsp; I am now on the point of
quitting this pretty place and making for my home at Hevitre,
where we trust to arrive next Thursday.</p>
<p>Present my best compliments to your mother, and believe me,
your faithful and obedient servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;<i>El hombre
propose pero Dios es que dispose</i>.&nbsp; I had hoped to have
run down and seen you and yours in your quiet Patmos; but the
Sangrados will it otherwise.&nbsp; I have never been quite free
from a tickling pain since the bronchitis of last year, and it
has recently assumed the form of extreme relaxation and
irritation in the uvula, which is that pendulous appendage which
hangs over the orifice of the throat.&nbsp; Mine has become so
seriously elongated that, after submitting for four days last
week to its being burnt with caustic every morning in the hopes
that it might thus crimp and contract itself, I <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>have been
obliged to have it amputated.&nbsp; This has left a great
soreness, which militates against talking and deglutition, and
would render our charming chats after the Madeira over la
cheminea del <i>cueldo</i> inadvisable.&nbsp; I therefore defer
the visit: my Sangrado recommends me, when the summer advances,
to fly away into change of air, change of scene; in short, must
seek an <i>hejira</i> as you made.&nbsp; How strange the
coincidence! but those who have wandered much about require
periodical migration, as the encaged quail twice a year beats its
breast against the wires.</p>
<p>I am not quite determined where to go, whether to Scotland and
the sweet heath-aired hills, or to the wild rocks and clear trout
streams of the Tyrol; it is a question between the gun and the
rod.&nbsp; If I go north assuredly si Dios quiere I will take
your friendly and peaceful abode in my way.</p>
<p>As to my immediate plans I can say nothing before Thursday,
when the Sangrado is to report on some diagnosis which he
expects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <i>Handbook</i> is all but out, and Lockhart and
Murray are eager to have you in the <i>Q. R.</i>&nbsp; I enclose
you a note from the editor.&nbsp; How feel you inclined?&nbsp; I
would send you down 30 sheets, and you might run your eye through
them.&nbsp; <i>There are plums in the pudding</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Richard
Ford</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A proof in slip form of the rejected review, with
Borrow&rsquo;s corrections written upon it, is in my
possession.&nbsp; Our author pictures Gibraltar as a human entity
thus addressing Spain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Accursed land!&nbsp; I hate thee, and far from
being a defence, will invariably prove a thorn in thy side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on through many sentences of excited rhetoric.&nbsp;
Borrow forgot while he wrote that he had a book to review&mdash;a
book, moreover, issued by the publishing house which issued the
periodical in which his review was to appear.&nbsp; And this book
was a book in ten thousand&mdash;a veritable mine of information
and out of the way learning.&nbsp; Surely this slight reference
amid many dissertations of his own upon Spain was to damn his
friend&rsquo;s book with faint praise:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Handbook is a Handbook after all, a very useful
thing, but still&mdash;the fact is that we live in an age of
humbug, in which everything, to obtain note and reputation, must
depend less upon its own intrinsic merit than on the name it
bears.&nbsp; The present book is about one of the best books ever
written upon Spain; but we are afraid that it will never be
estimated at its proper value; for after all a Handbook is a
Handbook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Yet
successful as was Ford&rsquo;s <i>Handbook</i>, it is doubtful
but that Borrow was right in saying that it had better have been
called <i>Wanderings in Spain</i> or <i>Wonders of the
Peninsula</i>.&nbsp; How much more gracious was the statement of
another great authority on Spain&mdash;Sir William
Stirling-Maxwell&mdash;who said that &ldquo;so great a literary
achievement had never before been performed under so humble a
title.&rdquo;&nbsp; The article, however, furnishes a trace of
autobiography in the statement by Borrow that he had long been in
the habit of reading <i>Don Quixote</i> once every nine
years.&nbsp; Yet he tells us that he prefers Le Sage&rsquo;s
<i>Gil Blas</i> to <i>Don Quixote</i>, &ldquo;the characters
introduced being certainly more true to nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
altogether we do not wonder that Lockhart declined to publish the
article.&nbsp; Here is the last letter in my possession; after
this there is one in the Knapp collection dated 1851,
acknowledging a copy of <i>Lavengro</i>, in which Fords adds:
&ldquo;Mind when you come to see the Exhibition you look in here,
for I long to have a chat,&rdquo; and so the friendship appears
to have collapsed as so many friendships do.&nbsp; Ford died at
Heavitree in 1858:</p>

168</span>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smcap">In Eastern Europe</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1844 Borrow set out for the most
distant holiday that he was ever to undertake.&nbsp; Passing
through London in March, 1844, he came under the critical eye of
Elizabeth Rigby, afterwards Lady Eastlake, that formidable critic
who four years later&mdash;in 1848&mdash;wrote the cruel review
of <i>Jane Eyre</i> in <i>The Quarterly</i> that gave so much
pain to Charlotte Bront&euml;.&nbsp; She was not a nice
woman.&nbsp; These sharp, &ldquo;clever&rdquo; women-critics
rarely are; and Borrow never made a pleasant impression when such
women came across his path&mdash;instance Harriet Martineau,
Frances Cobbe, and Agnes Strickland.&nbsp; We should sympathise
with him, and not count it for a limitation, as some of his
biographers have done.&nbsp; The future Lady Eastlake thus
disposes of Borrow in her one reference to him:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>March</i> 20.&mdash;Borrow came in the evening;
now a fine man, but a most disagreeable one; a kind of character
that would be most dangerous in rebellious times&mdash;one that
would suffer or persecute to the utmost.&nbsp; His face is
expressive of strong-headed determination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quoting this description of Borrow, Dr. Knapp describes it as
&ldquo;shallow&rdquo;&mdash;for &ldquo;he was one of the kindest
of men, as my documents show.&rdquo;&nbsp; The description is
shallow enough, because the writer had no kind of comprehension
of Borrow; but then, perhaps, his champion had not.&nbsp; Borrow
was neither one of the &ldquo;kindest of men&rdquo; nor the
reverse.&nbsp; He was a good hater and a whole-hearted lover, and
to be thus is to fill a certain uncomfortable but not
discreditable place in the scheme of things.&nbsp; About a month
later Borrow was on the way to the East, travelling by Paris and
Vienna.</p>
<p>In May he is in Vienna, whence he writes to his
wife:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span><span
class="smcap">To Mrs. George Borrow</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Vienna</span>,
<i>May</i> 16, 1844.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Carreta</span>,&mdash;I arrived
here the day before yesterday, and so early as yesterday I had
begun a letter for you, but I now commence another, as I have
rather altered my intentions since that time.&nbsp; I thought at
first I should not like this place, for the difficulty of finding
accommodation in the inns is very great.&nbsp; I went to four,
but found them all full, and though I at last got into one, it
was in every respect inconvenient and uncomfortable; to-day,
however, I have taken a lodging for a month, two handsome
chambers at about 25 shillings per week.&nbsp; I do not like
dark, gloomy places, as they affect my poor spirits
terribly.&nbsp; You will find the address farther on, and I wish
you to write to me, for I long so much to hear from my
dearest.&nbsp; Since I last wrote I have traversed nearly the
whole breadth of Germany.&nbsp; On leaving Strasbourg I passed
through what is called the Black Forest, a range of mountains
covered with pine forests; the scenery was grand and beautiful to
a degree.&nbsp; I then came to wide plains, which crossing I
reached Ulm and Augsburg, which last place, as you will see by
the map, is in the heart of Germany.&nbsp; It is celebrated for
what is called the Confession of Augsburg: that is, the
declaration of faith which was published there by Luther and the
other reformers.&nbsp; I then went to Munich, a beautiful city,
the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria, where there is a most
noble gallery of pictures; the porter is a giant about seven feet
high.&nbsp; I entered into discourse with him, and found him very
good-natured and communicative.&nbsp; From Munich I went to
Ratisbon, a fine old place, and there I embarked in a steamer
which goes down the Danube, the noblest river in Europe&mdash;you
cannot conceive anything equal to the grandeur of its
banks.&nbsp; Almost all the way from Ratisbon to Vienna it runs
amongst huge mountains covered with forests from the top to the
bottom; the stream is wonderfully rapid, running like a mill
flush; the waters are whitish, being continually fed by the snows
of the Alps.&nbsp; Here and there upon the banks you see the
ruins of old castles, which add considerably to the effect of the
scene; before reaching Vienna, however, it leaves the mountains
and spreads itself over a wide plain, in the midst of which
Vienna stands.&nbsp; Since I last wrote to you I have had some
strange adventures, but the strangest of all is the
following.</p>
<p>We were two days in coming down the Danube, and the first
night we stopped at Lenz, a frontier town of Austria, in the
heart of the mountains.&nbsp; I was very tired and low-spirited,
and, after looking about the town a little while, I went to the
inn where I had put up and went to bed.&nbsp; The evening was
dull, sultry and oppressive; the room, however, where I lay,
overlooked the Danube, and a refreshing coolness came from the
water through the window, which I had left open.&nbsp; I had <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>composed
myself and was just falling to sleep, when I was roused by a
knock at the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; I cried, and a
man in a pair of high Hessian boots, and dressed in black, walked
into the room.&nbsp; I had seen him on board the steamer, and had
held some conversation with him in French about Spain, concerning
which he seemed very inquisitive.&nbsp; He held something in his
hand which I could not distinguish, as it was dark, so much so
that I should have hardly recognized the man himself but for his
Hessian boots.&nbsp; He came straight to the bed and seized my
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;So it is you,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I almost
thought I recognized you on board the vessel by your manner of
discourse, but now I am certain: I have just seen your name below
inscribed by your own hand in the travellers&rsquo; book.&nbsp;
How astonishing, that I should thus have met the very person whom
I have long had the greatest desire to see!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have not the pleasure
of knowing you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the Dean of
Ratisbon,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and I come to beg, as the
greatest of favours, that you would condescend to write your name
in this book, which I always carry about with me when I
travel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then put into my hand Murray&rsquo;s
cheap edition of &ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; and, ringing
the bell, called for a light.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a Roman
Catholic,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I know how to appreciate
genius, especially such as yours.&nbsp; Whenever you set foot in
Ratisbon again, pray, pray take up your abode in my house . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vienna is a very strange place; I do not much like it, but I
think I can settle down here for a month tolerably well,
especially now I have procured a nice lodging, and commence
writing a little anew.&nbsp; God grant that I may be successful;
perhaps if I am I may yet see better days, and get rid of the
thoughts which have so long beset me.&nbsp; Though I have been
here only two days, I have already seen a great deal, amongst
other things the Emperor and the Empress; they go to the royal
chapel every morning, which, though in the palace, is open to
everybody.&nbsp; It is a small but beautiful chapel, very simple,
with a Christ on the Cross over the altar, a picture on the right
hand side, and Maria with her crown of rays on the left; four
tall Heyduks, or Hungarian soldiers, stand in front of the altar,
with their backs to the people and their faces to the officiating
priests.&nbsp; The singing was admirable; the <i>theatre
band</i>, which is perhaps the best in the world, being all
there, it was so powerful that the voices of the priests could
scarcely be heard.&nbsp; The Emperor sat in a kind of covered
gallery, his head and the upper part of his body visible through
a window; when the service was over, however, I had a full view
of him.&nbsp; I stood in one of the ante-rooms, through which he
passed to the interior of the palace; the Empress was at his
right hand.&nbsp; He is a small, diminutive man, not much more
than five feet high; his features, however, are pleasing and
good-humoured.&nbsp; The Empress is a head and shoulders taller,
and is about the finest woman I ever saw; she looked what she
is&mdash;Empress of one <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>of the most powerful nations of the
world.&nbsp; What a beautiful country is Germany, in every point
of view superior to France, which is anything but
beautiful.&nbsp; Notwithstanding its inhabitants call it
&ldquo;the lovely country,&rdquo; I have traversed it from south
to north, and from west to east, and have scarcely seen anything
pretty about it, save Versailles, and that is all art, whereas in
this country you see not a trace of art, nothing but wild and
beautiful nature.&nbsp; The people, moreover, are kind and good,
and not continually boasting of themselves and country like the
French.&nbsp; About nine days ago I wrote to my dear mother from
Augsburg; I hope she received the letter, and that she informed
you, my dearest, as I entreated her to do.&nbsp; I am now a great
way from you; Vienna is one of the cities in Europe the most
distant from England, double as far as Madrid, and more remote
even than St. Petersburg; it is about one thousand miles from
Paris.&nbsp; The Austrians are quite a distinct race, differing
very much from the Prussians and the people of the North of
Germany.&nbsp; You scarcely see any foreigners here&mdash;few
English or French&mdash;it is too far for a common trip, and the
means of conveyance much more slow than in other parts.&nbsp;
From here (D.V.) I intend to go to Hungary, which is close by,
being only a day&rsquo;s journey down the Danube; and from
thence, when I have spoken with the Gypsies, I shall make the
best of my way to Constantinople, and then home by Russia.&nbsp;
I want, if I possibly can, to compose my poor mind, for it is no
use running about countries unless the mind is at rest.&nbsp; I
knew that before I left home, but I had become so unsettled and
wretched, as you know, that I could not rest or do anything; the
last winter did me no good, and, indeed, we have all of us some
reason to remember it.&nbsp; I go on taking those
hom&oelig;opathic globules, but whether they are of any use or
effect I can scarcely say; there is one thing, however, which I
am sure is of much greater use and comfort to me&mdash;it is the
little book which my dearest gave me when I left her; I look into
it every morning, and sometimes twice or thrice a day.&nbsp; I
have done everything you bid me when I set out, and I hope to God
that when I return I shall find you well.&nbsp; You are almost my
only comfort here on earth, and without you I feel that I should
be lost and wild, and my sensations, alas, never deceive
me.&nbsp; I hope that in a week or two my dear mother will come
over and see you, and that she will be a comfort to you, and you
to her; poor, dear thing, she loves you, as well she has right,
for a kind, dear, and true wife you have been to her son.&nbsp;
Take care of those &mdash;, <i>leurs oreilles sont toujours
ouvertes</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let us be blinded a third
time.&nbsp; I hope all the animals are well.&nbsp; I saw to-day
in the street two enormous parrots or mackaws to sell&mdash;one
was quite white, and the other red.&nbsp; I thought of poor, dear
Hen.; I am making a collection of coins for her, gold and silver,
and I hope at my return to bring her some French, Turkish, and
Russian money.&nbsp; I shall be glad to get home, for it is
doleful to be alone, especially at night; I have, <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>however,
your little book, which I take in my hand, and which frequently
puts me to sleep.&nbsp; And now, my Carreta, I must conclude,
having said all I have to say for the present.&nbsp; This is my
direction:&mdash;</p>

<p>In June he is in Buda Pesth, whence he wrote to his wife:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Oulton</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lowestoft</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Pesth</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hungary</span>, 14<i>th</i> <i>June</i>
1844.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Carreta</span>,&mdash;I was so
glad to get your letter which reached me about nine days ago; on
receiving it, I instantly made preparations for quitting Vienna,
but owing to two or three things which delayed me, I did not get
away till the 20th; I hope that you received the last letter
which I sent, as I doubt not that you are all anxious to hear
from me.&nbsp; You cannot think how anxious I am to get back to
you, but since I am already come so far, it will not do to return
before my object is accomplished.&nbsp; Heaven knows that I do
not travel for travelling&rsquo;s sake, having a widely different
object in view.&nbsp; I came from Vienna here down the Danube,
but I daresay I shall not go farther by the river, but shall
travel through the country to Bucharest in Wallachia, which is
the next place I intend to visit; but Hungary is a widely
different country to Austria, not at all civilised, no coaches,
etc., but only carts and wagons; however, it is all the same
thing to me as I am quite used to rough it; Bucharest is about
three hundred miles from here; the country, as I have said
before, is wild, but the people are quite harmless&mdash;it is
only in Spain that any danger is to be feared from your fellow
creatures.&nbsp; In Bucharest I shall probably stay a
fortnight.&nbsp; I have a letter to a French gentleman there from
Baron Taylor.&nbsp; Pesth is very much like Edinburgh&mdash;there
is an old and a new town, and it is only the latter which is
called Pesth, the name of the old is Buda, which stands on the
side of an enormous mountain overlooking the new town, the Danube
running between.&nbsp; The two towns together contain about
120,000 inhabitants; I delivered the <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>letter which dear Woodfall was kind
enough to send; it was to a person, a Scotchman, who is
superintending in the building of the chain bridge over the
Danube; he is a very nice person, and has shown me every kind of
civility; indeed, every person here is very civil; yesterday I
dined at the house of a rich Greek; the dinner was magnificent,
the only drawback was that they pressed me too much to eat and
drink; there was a deal of champagne, and they would make me
drink it till I was almost sick, for it is a wine that I do not
like, being far too sweet.&nbsp; Since I have been here I have
bathed twice in the Danube, and find myself much the better for
it; I both sleep and eat better than I did.&nbsp; I have also
been about another chapter, and get on tolerably well; were I not
so particular I should get on faster, but I wish that everything
that I write in this next be first rate.&nbsp; Tell Mama that
this chapter begins with a dialogue between her and my father; I
have likewise contrived to bring in the poor old dog in a manner
which I think will be interesting.&nbsp; I began this letter some
days ago, but have been so pleasantly occupied that I have made
little progress till now.&nbsp; Clarke, poor fellow, does not
know how to make enough of me.&nbsp; He says he could scarcely
believe his eyes when he first received the letter, as he has
just got <i>The Bible in Spain</i> from England, and was reading
it.&nbsp; This is the 17th, and in a few days I start for a place
called Debreczen, from whence I shall proceed gradually on my
journey.&nbsp; The next letter which you receive will probably be
from Transylvania, the one after that from Bucharest, and the
third D.V. from Constantinople.&nbsp; If you like you may write
to Constantinople, directing it to the care of the English
Ambassador, but be sure to pay the postage.</p>
<p>Before I left Vienna Baron Hammer, the great Orientalist,
called upon me; his wife was just dead, poor thing, which
prevented him showing me all the civility which he would
otherwise have done.&nbsp; He took me to the Imperial
Library.&nbsp; Both my books were there, <i>Gypsies</i> and
<i>Bible</i>.&nbsp; He likewise procured me a ticket to see the
Imperial treasure.&nbsp; (Tell Henrietta that I saw there the
diamond of Charles the Bold; it is as large as a walnut.)&nbsp; I
likewise saw the finest opal, as I suppose, in the world; it was
the size of a middling pear; there was likewise a hyacinth as big
as a swan&rsquo;s egg; I likewise saw a pearl so large that they
had wrought the figure of a cock out of it, and the cock was
somewhat more than an inch high, but the thing which struck me
most was the sword of Tamerlane, generally called Timour the
Tartar; both the hilt and scabbard were richly adorned with
diamonds and emeralds, but I thought more of the man than I did
of them, for he was the greatest conqueror the world ever saw (I
have spoken of him in <i>Lavengro</i> in the chapter about David
Haggart).&nbsp; Nevertheless, although I have seen all these fine
things, I shall be glad to get back to my Carreta and my darling
mother and to dear Hen.&nbsp; From Debreczen I hope to write to
kind dear Woodfall, and to Lord <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>from Constantinople.&nbsp; I must
likewise write to Hasfeld.&nbsp; The mulct of thirty pounds upon
Russian passports is only intended for the subjects of
Russia.&nbsp; I see by the journals that the Emperor has been in
England; I wonder what he is come about; however, the less I say
about that the better, as I shall soon be in his country.&nbsp;
Tell Hen that I have got her a large piece of Austrian gold
money, worth about forty-two shillings; it is quite new and very
handsome; considerably wider than the Spanish ounce, only not
near so thick, as might be expected, being of considerably less
value; when I get to Constantinople I will endeavour to get a
Turkish gold coin.&nbsp; I have also got a new Austrian silver
dollar and a half one; these are rather cumbersome, and I
don&rsquo;t care much about them&mdash;as for the large gold
coin, I carry it in my pocket-book, which has been of great use
to me hitherto.&nbsp; I have not yet lost anything, only a pocket
handkerchief or two as usual; but I was obliged to buy two other
shirts at Vienna; the weather is so hot, that it is quite
necessary to change them every other day; they were beautiful
linen ones, and I think you will like them when you see.&nbsp; I
shall be so glad to get home and continue, if possible, my old
occupation.&nbsp; I hope my next book will sell; one comfort is
that nothing like it has ever been published before.&nbsp; I hope
you all get on comfortably, and that you catch some fish.&nbsp; I
hope my dear mother is well, and that she will continue with you
till the end of July at least; ah! that is my month, I was born
in it, it is the pleasantest month in the year; would to God that
my fate had worn as pleasant an aspect as the month in which I
was born.&nbsp; God bless you all.&nbsp; Write to me, <i>to the
care of the British Embassy</i>, Constantinople.&nbsp; Kind
remembrances to Pilgrim.</p>

<p>In the intervening journey between Pesth and Constantinople he
must have talked long and wandered far and wide among the
gypsies, for Charles L. Brace in his <i>Hungary in</i> 1851 gives
us a glimpse of him at Grosswardein holding conversation with the
gypsies:</p>
<blockquote><p>They described his appearance&mdash;his tall,
lank, muscular form&mdash;and mentioned that he had been much in
Spain, and I saw that it must be that most ubiquitous of
travellers, Mr. Borrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four following letters require no comment:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Oulton</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lowestoft</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Debreczen</span>, <span
class="smcap">Hungary</span>, 8<i>th</i> <i>July</i> 1844.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My darling Carreta</span>,&mdash;I write
to you from Debreczen, a town in the heart of Hungary, where I
have been for the last fortnight with the exception of three days
during which I was making a journey to Tokay, which is about
forty miles distant.&nbsp; <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>My reason for staying here so long
was my liking the place where I have experienced every kind of
hospitality; almost all the people in these parts are
Protestants, and they are so fond of the very name of Englishman
that when one arrives they scarcely know how to make enough of
him; it is well the place is so remote that very few are ever
seen here, perhaps not oftener than once in ten years, for if
some of our scamps and swell mob were once to find their way
there the good people of Hungary would soon cease to have much
respect for the English in general; as it is they think that they
are all men of honour and accomplished gentlemen whom it becomes
them to receive well in order that they may receive from them
lessons in civilisation; I wonder what they would think if they
were to meet such fellows as Squarem and others whom I could
mention.&nbsp; I find my knowledge of languages here of great
use, and the people are astonished to hear me speak French,
Italian, German, Russian, and occasionally Gypsy.&nbsp; I have
already met with several Gypsies; those who live abroad in the
wildernesses are quite black; the more civilised wander about as
musicians, playing on the fiddle, at which they are very expert,
they speak the same languages as those in England, with slight
variations, and upon the whole they understand me very
well.&nbsp; Amongst other places I have been to Tokay, where I
drank some of the wine.&nbsp; I am endeavouring to bring two or
three bottles to England, for I thought of my mother and yourself
and Hen., and I have got a little wooden case made; it is very
sweet and of a pale straw colour; whether I shall be able to
manage it I do not know; however, I shall make the attempt.&nbsp;
At Tokay the wine is only two shillings the bottle, and I have a
great desire that you should taste some of it.&nbsp; I sincerely
hope that we shall soon all meet together in health and
peace.&nbsp; I shall be glad enough to get home, but since I am
come so far it is as well to see as much as possible.&nbsp; Would
you think it, the Bishop of Debreczen came to see me the other
day and escorted me about the town, followed by all the
professors of the college; this was done merely because I was an
Englishman and a Protestant, for here they are almost all of the
reformed religion and full of love and enthusiasm for it.&nbsp;
It is probable that you will hear from Woodfall in a day or two;
the day before yesterday I wrote to him and begged him to write
to you to let you know, as I am fearful of a letter miscarrying
and your being uneasy.&nbsp; This is unfortunately post day and I
must send away the letter in a very little time, so that I cannot
say all to you that I could wish; I shall stay here about a week
longer, and from here shall make the best of my way to
Transylvania and Bucharest; I shall stay at Bucharest about a
fortnight, and shall then dash off for Constantinople&mdash;I
shan&rsquo;t stay there long&mdash;but when once there it matters
not as it is a civilised country from which start steamers to any
part where you may want to go.&nbsp; I hope to receive a letter
from you there.&nbsp; You cannot imagine what pleasure I felt
when I got your last.&nbsp; Oh, it was <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>such a
comfort to me!&nbsp; I shall have much to tell you when I get
back.&nbsp; Yesterday I went to see a poor wretch who is about to
be hanged; he committed a murder here two years ago, and the day
after tomorrow he is to be executed&mdash;they expose the people
here who are to suffer three days previous to their
execution&mdash;I found him in a small apartment guarded by
soldiers, with hundreds of people staring at him through the door
and the windows; I was admitted into the room as I went with two
officers; he had an enormous chain about his waist and his feet
were manacled; he sat smoking a pipe; he was, however, very
penitent, and said that he deserved to die, as well he might; he
had murdered four people, beating out their brains with a club;
he was without work, and requested of an honest man here to
receive him into his house one night until the morning.&nbsp; In
the middle of the night he got up, and with his brother, who was
with him, killed every person in the house and then plundered it;
two days after, he was taken; his brother died in prison; I gave
him a little money, and the gentleman who was with me gave him
some good advice; he looked most like a wild beast, a huge mantle
of skin covered his body; for nine months he had not seen the
daylight; but now he is brought out into a nice clean apartment,
and allowed to have everything he asks for, meat, wine,
tobacco&mdash;nothing is refused him during these last three
days.&nbsp; I cannot help thinking that it is a great cruelty to
keep people so long in so horrid a situation; it is two years
nearly since he has been condemned.&nbsp; Do not be anxious if
you do not hear from me regularly for some time.&nbsp; There is
no escort post in the countries to which I am going.&nbsp; God
bless my mother, yourself, and Hen.</p>

winter commences at the beginning of September.&nbsp; I thought

because I wished to see and learn as much as I could, for it was
no use coming to such a distance for nothing.&nbsp; By the time I
return I shall have made a most enormous journey, such as very
few have made.&nbsp; The place from which I write is very
romantic, being situated at the foot of a ridge of enormous
mountains which extend to the clouds, they look higher than the
Pyrenees.&nbsp; My health, thank God, is very good.&nbsp; I
bathed to-day and feel all the better for it; I hope you are
getting on well, and that all our dear family is
comfortable.&nbsp; I hope my dear mother is well.&nbsp; Oh, it is
so pleasant to hope that I am still not alone in the world, and
that there are those who love and care for me and pray for
me.&nbsp; I shall be very glad to get to Constantinople, as from
there there is no difficulty; and a great part of the way to
Russia is by sea, and when I am in Russia I am almost at
home.&nbsp; I shall write to you again from Bucharest if it
please God.&nbsp; It is not much more than eighty miles from
here, but the way lies over mountains, so that the journey will
take three or four days.&nbsp; We travel here in tilted carts
drawn by ponies; the carts are without springs, so that one is
terribly shaken.&nbsp; It is, however, very healthy, especially
when one has a strong constitution.&nbsp; The carts are chiefly
made of sticks and wickerwork; they are, of course, very slight,
and indeed if they were not so they would soon go to pieces owing
to the jolting.&nbsp; I read your little book every morning; it
is true that I am sometimes wrong with respect to the date, but I
soon get right again; oh, I shall be so glad to see you and my
mother and old Hen. and Lucy and the whole dear circle.&nbsp; I

<p>The best letter that I have of this journey, and indeed the
best letter of Borrow&rsquo;s that I have read, is one from
Constantinople to his wife&mdash;the only letter by him from that
city:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My darling Carreta</span>,&mdash;I am
about to leave Constantinople and to return home.&nbsp; I have
given up the idea of going to Russia; I find that if I go to
Odessa I shall have to remain in quarantine for fourteen days,
which I have no inclination to do; I am, moreover, anxious to get
home, being quite tired of wandering, and desirous of being once
more with my loved ones.&nbsp; This is a most interesting place,
but unfortunately it is extremely dear.&nbsp; The Turks have no
inns, and I am here at an English one, at which, though
everything is comfortable, the prices are very high.&nbsp; To-day
is Monday, and next Friday I purpose starting for Salonica in a
steamboat&mdash;Salonica is in Albania.&nbsp; I shall then cross
Albania, a journey of about three hundred miles, and get to
Corfu, from which I can either get to England across Italy and
down the Rhine, or by way of Marseilles and across France.&nbsp;
I shall not make any stay in Italy if I go there, as I have
nothing to see there.&nbsp; I shall be so glad to be at home with
you once again, and to see my dear mother and Hen.&nbsp; Tell
Hen. that I picked up for her in one of the bazaars a curious
Armenian coin; it is silver, small, but thick, with a most
curious inscription upon it.&nbsp; I gave fifteen piastres for
it.&nbsp; I hope it and the rest will get safe to England.&nbsp;
I have bought a chest, which I intend to send by sea, and I have
picked up a great many books and other things, and I wish to
travel light; I shall, therefore, only take a bag with a few
clothes and shirts.&nbsp; It is possible that I shall be at home
soon after your receiving this, or at most three weeks
after.&nbsp; I hope to write to you again from Corfu, which is a
British island with a British garrison in it, like Gibraltar; the
English newspapers came last week.&nbsp; I see those wretched
French cannot let us alone, they want to go to war; well, let
them; they richly deserve a good drubbing.&nbsp; The people here
are very kind in their way, but home is home, especially such a
one as mine, with true hearts to welcome me.&nbsp; Oh, I was so
glad to get your letters; they were rather of a distant date, it
is true, but they <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>quite revived me.&nbsp; I hope you are all well, and my
dear mother.&nbsp; Since I have been here I have written to Mr.
Lord.&nbsp; I was glad to hear that he has written to Hen.&nbsp;
I hope Lucy is well; pray remember me most kindly to her, and
tell her that I hope to see her soon.&nbsp; I count so of getting
into my summer-house again, and sitting down to write; I have
arranged my book in my mind, and though it will take me a great
deal of trouble to write it, I feel that when it is written it
will be first-rate.&nbsp; My journey, with God&rsquo;s help, has
done me a great deal of good.&nbsp; I am stronger than I was, and
I can now sleep.&nbsp; I intend to draw on England for forty or
fifty pounds; if I don&rsquo;t want the whole of it, it will be
all the same.&nbsp; I have still some money left, but I have no
wish to be stopped on my journey for want of it.&nbsp; I am sorry
about what you told me respecting the railway, sorry that the old
coach is driven off the road.&nbsp; I shall patronise it as
little as possible, but stick to the old route and Thurton
George.&nbsp; What a number of poor people will these railroads
deprive of their bread.&nbsp; I am grieved at what you say about
poor M.; he can take her into custody, however, and oblige her to
support the children; such is law, though the property may have
been secured to her, she can be compelled to do that.&nbsp; Tell
Hen. that there is a mosque here, called the mosque of Sultan
Bajazet; it is full of sacred pigeons; there is a corner of the
court to which the creatures flock to be fed, like bees, by
hundreds and thousands; they are not at all afraid, as they are
never killed.&nbsp; Every place where they can roost is covered
with them, their impudence is great; they sprang originally from
two pigeons brought from Asia by the Emperor of
Constantinople.&nbsp; They are of a deep blue.&nbsp; God bless
you, dearest.</p>

<p>He returned home by way of Venice and Rome as the following
two letters indicate:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Oulton</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lowestoft</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Venice</span>,
22<i>nd</i> <i>Octr.</i> 1844.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Carreta</span>,&mdash;I arrived
this day at Venice, and though I am exceedingly tired I hasten to
write a line to inform you of my well-being.&nbsp; I am now
making for home as fast as possible, and I have now nothing to
detain me.&nbsp; Since I wrote to you last I have been again in
quarantine for two days and a half at Trieste, but I am glad to
say that I shall no longer be detained on that account.&nbsp; I
was obliged to go to Trieste, though it was much out of my way,
otherwise I must have remained I know not how long in Corfu,
waiting for a direct conveyance.&nbsp; After my liberation I only
stopped a day at Corfu in order that I might lose no more time,
though I really wished to tarry there a little longer, the people
were so kind.&nbsp; On the <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>day of my liberation, I had four
invitations to dinner from the officers.&nbsp; I, however, made
the most of my time, and escorted by one Captain Northcott, of
the Rifles, went over the fortifications, which are most
magnificent.&nbsp; I saw everything that I well could, and shall
never forget the kindness with which I was treated.&nbsp; The
next day I went to Trieste in a steamer, down the whole length of
the Adriatic.&nbsp; I was horribly unwell, for the Adriatic is a
bad sea, and very dangerous; the weather was also very rough;
after stopping at Trieste a day, besides the quarantine, I left
for Venice, and here I am, and hope to be on my route again the
day after to-morrow.&nbsp; I shall now hurry through Italy by way
of Ancona, Rome, and Civita Vecchia to Marseilles in France and
from Marseilles to London, in not more than six days&rsquo;
journey.&nbsp; Oh, I shall be so glad to get back to you and my
mother (I hope she is alive and well) and Hen.&nbsp; I am glad to
hear that we are not to have war with those silly people, the
French.&nbsp; The idea made me very uneasy, for I thought how
near Oulton lay to the coast.&nbsp; You cannot imagine what a
magnificent old town Venice is; it is clearly the finest in
Italy, although in decay; it stands upon islands in the sea, and
in many places is intersected with canals.&nbsp; The Grand Canal
is four miles long, lined with palaces on either side.&nbsp; I,
however, shall be glad to leave it, for there is no place to me
like Oulton, where live two of my dear ones.&nbsp; I have told
you that I am very tired, so that I cannot write much more, and I
am presently going to bed, but I am sure that you will be glad to
hear from me, however little I may write.&nbsp; I think I told
you in my last letter that I had been to the top of Mount Olympus
in Thessaly.&nbsp; Tell Hen. that I saw a whole herd of wild deer
bounding down the cliffs, the noise they made was like thunder; I
also saw an enormous eagle&mdash;one of Jupiter&rsquo;s birds,
his real eagles, for, according to the Grecian mythology, Olympus
was his favourite haunt.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what it was
then, but at present the most wild savage place I ever saw; an
immense way up I came to a forest of pines; half of them were
broken by thunderbolts, snapped in the middle, and the ruins
lying around in the most hideous confusion; some had been blasted
from top to bottom and stood naked, black, and charred, in
indescribable horridness; Jupiter was the god of thunder, and he
still seems to haunt Olympus.&nbsp; The worst is there is little
water, so that a person might almost perish there of thirst; the
snow-water, however, when it runs into the hollows is the most
delicious beverage ever tasted&mdash;the snow, however, is very
high up.&nbsp; My next letter, I hope, will be from Marseilles,
and I hope to be there in a very few days.&nbsp; Now, God bless
you, my dearest; write to my mother, and kiss Hen., and remember
me kindly to Lucy and the Atkinses.</p>

<h2><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smcap">Lavengro</span></h2>
<p><i>The Bible in Spain</i> bears on its title-page the date
1843.&nbsp; In the intervening eight or nine years he had
travelled much&mdash;suffered much.&nbsp; During all these years
he had been thinking about, talking about, his next book, making
no secret of the fact that it was to be an Autobiography.&nbsp;
Even before <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was issued he had written
to Mr. John Murray foreshadowing a book in which his father,
William Taylor, and others were to put in an appearance.&nbsp; In
the &ldquo;Advertisement&rdquo; to <i>The Romany Rye</i> he tells
us that &ldquo;the principal part of <i>Lavengro</i> was written
in the year &rsquo;43, that the whole of it was completed before
the termination of the year &rsquo;46, and that it was in the
hands of the publisher in the year &rsquo;48.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the
idea grew in his mind, his friend, Richard Ford, gave him much
sound advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never mind nimminy-pimminy people thinking
subjects <i>low</i>.&nbsp; Things are low in manner of
handling.&nbsp; Draw Nature in rags and poverty, yet draw her
truly, and how picturesque!&nbsp; I hate your silver fork, kid
glove, curly-haired school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so in the following years, now to Ford, now to Murray, he
traces his progress, while in 1844 he tells Dawson Turner that he
is &ldquo;at present engaged in a kind of Biography in the
Robinson Crusoe style.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in the same year he went
to Buda-Pesth, Venice, and Constantinople.&nbsp; The first
advertisement of the book appeared in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>
in July, 1848, when <i>Lavengro</i>, <i>An Autobiography</i>, was
announced.&nbsp; Later in the same year Mr. Murray advertised the
book as <i>Life</i>, <i>A Drama</i>, and Dr. Knapp, who had in
his collection the original proof-sheets of <i>Lavengro</i>,
reproduced the title-page of the book which then stood as
<i>Life</i>, <i>A Drama</i>, and bore the date 1849.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s procrastination in delivering the complete book
worried John Murray exceedingly.&nbsp; Not unnaturally, for in
1848 he had offered the book at his annual sale dinner to the
booksellers who had <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>subscribed to it liberally.&nbsp;
Eighteen months later Murray was still worrying Borrow for the
return of the proof-sheets of the third and last volume.&nbsp;
Not until January, 1850, do we hear of it as <i>Lavengro</i>,
<i>An Autobiography</i>, and under this title it was advertised
in <i>The Quarterly Review</i> for that month as &ldquo;nearly
ready for publication.&rdquo;&nbsp; In April, 1850, we find
Woodfall, John Murray&rsquo;s printer, writing letter after
letter urging celerity, to which Mrs. Borrow replies, excusing
the delay on account of her husband&rsquo;s indifferent
health.&nbsp; They have been together in lodgings at
Yarmouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had many plunges into the briny Ocean,
which seemed to do him good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Murray continued to
exhort, but the final chapter did not reach him.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
sale is fixed for December 12th,&rdquo; he writes in November,
&ldquo;and if I cannot show the book then I must throw it
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; This threat had little effect, for on 13th
December we find Murray still coaxing his dilatory author,
telling him with justice that there were passages in his book
&ldquo;equal to Defoe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The very printer, Mr.
Woodfall, joined in the chase.&nbsp; &ldquo;The public is quite
prepared to devour your book,&rdquo; he wrote, which was
unhappily not the case.&nbsp; Nor was Ford a happier prophet,
although a true friend when he wrote&mdash;&ldquo;I am sure it
will be <i>the</i> book of the year when it is brought
forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The activity of Mrs. Borrow in this matter of
the publication of <i>Lavengro</i> is interesting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My husband . . . is, I assure you, doing all he can as
regards the completion of the book,&rdquo; she writes to Mr.
Murray in December, 1849, and in November of the following year
Murray writes to her to say that he is engraving Phillips&rsquo;s
portrait of Borrow for the book.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think a cheering
letter from you will do Mr. Borrow good,&rdquo; she writes
later.&nbsp; Throughout the whole correspondence between
publisher and printer we are impressed by Mrs. Borrow&rsquo;s
keen interest in her husband&rsquo;s book, her anxiety that he
should be humoured.&nbsp; Sadly did Borrow need to be humoured,
for if he had cherished the illusion that his book would really
be the &ldquo;Book of the Year&rdquo; he was to suffer a cruel
disillusion.&nbsp; Scarcely any one wanted it.&nbsp; All the
critics abused it.&nbsp; In <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> it was
bluntly pronounced a failure.&nbsp; &ldquo;The story of
<i>Lavengro</i> will content no one,&rdquo; said Sir William
Stirling-Maxwell in <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>.&nbsp; The
book &ldquo;will add but little to Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s
reputation,&rdquo; said <i>Blackwood</i>.&nbsp; The only real
insight <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>into the book&rsquo;s significance was provided by
Thomas Gordon Hake in a letter to <i>The New Monthly Review</i>,
in which journal the editor, Harrison Ainsworth, had already
pronounced a not very favourable opinion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Lavengro&rsquo;s</i> roots will strike deep into the
soil of English letters,&rdquo; wrote Dr. Hake, and he then
pronounced a verdict now universally accepted.&nbsp; George Henry
Lewes once happily remarked that he would make an appreciation of
Boswell&rsquo;s <i>Life of Johnson</i> a test of
friendship.&nbsp; Many of us would be almost equally inclined to
make such a test of Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp;
Tennyson declared that an enthusiasm for Milton&rsquo;s
<i>Lycidas</i> was a touchstone of taste in poetry.&nbsp; May we
not say that an enthusiasm for Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Lavengro</i> is
now a touchstone of taste in English prose literature?</p>
<p>But the reception of <i>Lavengro</i> by the critics, and also
by the public, may be said to have destroyed Borrow&rsquo;s moral
fibre.&nbsp; Henceforth, it was a soured and disappointed man who
went forth to meet the world.&nbsp; We hear much in the gossip of
contemporaries of Borrow&rsquo;s eccentricities, it may be of his
rudeness and gruffness, in the last years of his life.&nbsp; Only
those who can realise the personality of a self-contained man,
conscious, as all genius has ever been, of its achievement, and
conscious also of the failure of the world to recognise, will
understand&mdash;and will sympathise.</p>
<p>Borrow, as we have seen, took many years to write
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am writing the work,&rdquo; he
told Dawson Turner, &ldquo;in precisely the same manner as <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, viz., on blank sheets of old account-books,
backs of letters, etc.,&rdquo; and he recalls Mahomet writing the
Koran on mutton bones as an analogy to his own
&ldquo;slovenliness of manuscript.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have had plenty
of opportunity of testing this slovenliness in the collection of
manuscripts of portions of <i>Lavengro</i> that have come into my
possession.&nbsp; These are written upon pieces of paper of all
shapes and sizes, although at least a third of the book in
Borrow&rsquo;s very neat handwriting is contained in a leather
notebook, of which I give examples of the title-page and opening
leaf in facsimile.&nbsp; The title-page demonstrates the earliest
form of Borrow&rsquo;s conception.&nbsp; Not only did he then
contemplate an undisguised autobiography, but even described
himself, as he frequently did in his conversation, as &ldquo;a
Norfolk man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before the book was finished, however,
he repudiated the autobiographical <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>note, and by the time he sat down to
write <i>The Romany Rye</i> we find him fiercely denouncing his
critics for coming to such a conclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
writer,&rdquo; he declares, &ldquo;never said it was an
autobiography; never authorised any person to say it was
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was doubtless true, in a measure.&nbsp;
Yet I find among my Borrow Papers the following letter from
Whitwell Elwin, who, writing from Booton Rectory on 21st October,
1853, and addressing him as &ldquo;My dear Mr. Borrow,&rdquo;
said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hoped to have been able to call upon you at
Yarmouth, but a heavy cold first, and now occupation, have
interfered with my intentions.&nbsp; I daresay you have seen the
mention made of your <i>Lavengro</i> in the article on Haydon in
the current number of <i>The Quarterly Review</i>, and I thought
you might like to know that every syllable, both comment and
extract, was inserted by the writer (a man little given to
praise) of his own <i>accord</i>.&nbsp; Murray sent him your
book, and that was all.&nbsp; No addition or modification was
made by myself, and it is therefore the unbiassed judgment of a
<i>very critical</i> reviewer.&nbsp; Whenever you appear again
before the public I shall endeavour to do ample justice to your
past and present merits, and there is one point in which you
could aid those who understand you and your books in bringing
over general readers to your side.&nbsp; I was myself acquainted
with many of the persons you have sketched in your
<i>Lavengro</i>, and I can testify to the extraordinary vividness
and accuracy of the portraits.&nbsp; What I have seen, again, of
yourself tells me that romantic adventures are your natural
element, and I should <i>a priori</i> expect that much of your
history would be stranger than fiction.&nbsp; But you must
remember that the bulk of readers have no personal acquaintance
with you, or the characters you describe.&nbsp; The consequence
is that they fancy there is an immensity of romance mixed up with
the facts, and they are irritated by the inability to distinguish
between them.&nbsp; I am confident, from all I have heard, that
this was the source of the comparatively cold reception of
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; I should have partaken the feeling myself
if I had not had the means of testing the fidelity of many
portions of the book, from which I inferred the equal fidelity of
the rest.&nbsp; I think you have the remedy in your own hands,
viz., by giving the utmost possible matter-of-fact air to your
sequel.&nbsp; I do not mean that you are to tame down the truth,
but some ways of narrating a story make it seem more credible
than others, and if you were so far to defer to the ignorance of
the public they would enter into the full spirit of your rich and
racy narrative.&nbsp; You naturally look at your life from your
own point of view, and this in itself is the best; but when you
publish a book you invite the reader to participate in the events
of your career, and it is necessary then to look a little at
things <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>from <i>his</i> point of view.&nbsp; As he has not your
knowledge you must stoop to him.&nbsp; I throw this out for your
consideration.&nbsp; My sole wish is that the public should have
a right estimate of you, and surely you ought to do what is in
your power to help them to it.&nbsp; I know you will excuse the
liberty I take in offering this crude suggestion.&nbsp; Take it
for what it is worth, but anyhow . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this letter, as we learn from Elwin&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>,
&ldquo;instead of roaring like a lion,&rdquo; as Elwin had
expected, he returned quite a &ldquo;lamb-like note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Read by the light in which we all judge the book to-day, this
estimate by Elwin was about as fatuous as most contemporary
criticisms of a masterpiece.&nbsp; Which is only to say that it
is rarely given to contemporary critics to judge accurately of
the great work that comes to them amid a mass that is not
great.&nbsp; That Elwin, although not a good editor of Pope, was
a sound critic of the literature of a period anterior to his own
is demonstrated by the admirable essays from his pen that have
been reprinted with an excellent memoir of him by his son.&nbsp;
In this memoir we have a capital glimpse of our hero:</p>
<blockquote><p>Among the notables whom he had met was Borrow,
whose <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Romany Rye</i> he afterwards
reviewed in 1857 under the title of &ldquo;Roving Life in
England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their interview was characteristic of
both.&nbsp; Borrow was just then very sore with his snarling
critics, and on some one mentioning that Elwin was a
<i>quartering</i> reviewer, he said, &ldquo;Sir, I wish you a
better employment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then hastily changing the subject
he called out, &ldquo;What party are <i>you</i> in the
Church&mdash;Tractarian, Moderate, or Evangelical?&nbsp; I am
happy to say I am the old <i>High</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
happy to say I am <i>not</i>,&rdquo; was Elwin&rsquo;s emphatic
reply.&nbsp; Borrow boasted of his proficiency in the Norfolk
dialect, which he endeavoured to speak as broadly as
possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; said Elwin, &ldquo;that
he had not cultivated it with his usual success.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
the conversation proceeded it became less disputatious, and the
two ended by becoming so cordial that they promised to visit each
other.&nbsp; Borrow fulfilled his promise in the following
October, when he went to Booton, and was &ldquo;full of anecdote
and reminiscence,&rdquo; and delighted the rectory children by
singing them songs in the gypsy tongue.&nbsp; Elwin during this
visit urged him to try his hand at an article for the
<i>Review</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have
made a resolution never to have anything to do with such a
blackguard trade.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While writing of Whitwell Elwin and his association with
Borrow, which was sometimes rather strained as we <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>shall see
when <i>The Romany Rye</i> comes to be published, it is
interesting to turn to Elwin&rsquo;s final impression of Borrow,
as conveyed in a letter which the recipient has kindly placed at
my disposal.&nbsp; It was written from Booton Rectory, and is
dated 27th October, 1893:</p>
<blockquote><p>I used occasionally to meet Borrow at the house of
Mr. Murray, his publisher, and he once stayed with me here for
two or three days about 1855.&nbsp; He always seemed to me quite
at ease &ldquo;among refined people,&rdquo; and I should not have
ascribed his dogmatic tone, when he adopted it, to his resentment
at finding himself out of keeping with his society.&nbsp; A
spirit of self-assertion was engrained in him, and it was
supported by a combative temperament.&nbsp; As he was proud of
his bodily prowess, and rather given to parade it, so he took the
same view of an argument as of a battle with fists, and thought
that manliness required him to be determined and
unflinching.&nbsp; But this, in my experience of him, was not his
ordinary manner, which was calm and companionable, without
rudeness of any kind, unless some difference occurred to provoke
his pugnacity.&nbsp; I have witnessed instances of his care to
avoid wounding feelings needlessly.&nbsp; He never kept back his
opinions which, on some points, were shallow and even absurd; and
when his antagonist was as persistently positive as himself, he
was apt to be over vehement in contradiction.&nbsp; I have heard
Mr. Murray say that once in a dispute with Dr. Whewell at a
dinner the language on both sides grew so fiery that Mrs. Whewell
fainted.</p>
<p>He told me that his composition cost him a vast amount of
labour, that his first draughts were diffuse and crude, and that
he wrote his productions several times before he had condensed
and polished them to his mind.&nbsp; There is nothing choicer in
the English language than some of his narratives, descriptions,
and sketches of character, but in his best books he did not
always prune sufficiently, and in his last work, <i>Wild
Wales</i>, he seemed to me to have lost the faculty
altogether.&nbsp; Mr. Murray long refused to publish it unless it
was curtailed, and Borrow, with his usual self-will and
self-confidence, refused to retrench the trivialities.&nbsp;
Either he got his own way in the end, or he revised his
manuscript to little purpose.</p>
<p>Probably most of what there was to tell of Borrow has been
related by himself.&nbsp; It is a disadvantage in <i>Lavengro</i>
and <i>Romany Rye</i> that we cannot with certainty separate fact
from fiction, for he avowed in talk that, like Goethe, he had
assumed the right in the interests of his autobiographical
narrative to embellish it in places; but the main outline, and
larger part of the details, are the genuine record of what he had
seen and done, and I can testify that some of his minor
personages who were known to me in my boyhood are described with
perfect accuracy.</p>

<p>Two letters by Mr. Elwin to Borrow, from my Borrow <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Papers,
both dated 1853&mdash;two years after <i>Lavengro</i> was
written&mdash;may well have place here:</p>

luggage to the bow of your saddle, and spend as much time under
my roof as you can spare.&nbsp; I am always at home.&nbsp; Mrs.
Elwin is sure to be in the house or garden, and I, at the worst,
not further off than the extreme boundary of my parish.&nbsp;
Pray come and that quickly.&nbsp; Your shortest road from Norwich
is through Horsford, and from thence to the park wall of
Haverland Hall, which you skirt.&nbsp; This will bring you out by
a small wayside public house, well known in these parts, called
&ldquo;The Rat-catchers.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this point you turn
sharp to the left, and keep the straight road till you come to a
church with a new red brick house adjoining, which is your
journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>The conclusion of your note to me is so true in sentiment, and
so admirable in expression, that I hope you will introduce it
into your next work.&nbsp; I wish it had been said in the article
on Haydon.&nbsp; Cannot you strew such criticisms through the
sequel to <i>Lavengro</i>?&nbsp; They would give additional charm
and value to the work.&nbsp; Believe me, very truly yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">W.

<p>You are of course aware that if <i>I</i> had spoken of

passage go forth unadulterated.</p>

<p>I have said that I possess large portions of <i>Lavengro</i>
in manuscript.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s always helpful wife, however,
copied <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>out the whole manuscript for the publishers, and this
&ldquo;clean copy&rdquo; came to Dr. Knapp, who found even here a
few pages of very valuable writing deleted, and these he has very
rightly restored in Mr. Murray&rsquo;s edition of
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; Why Borrow took so much pains to explain
that his wife had copied <i>Lavengro</i>, as the following
document implies, I cannot think.&nbsp; I find in his handwriting
this scrap of paper signed by Mary Borrow, and witnessed by her
daughter:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>Janry.</i> 30,
1869,</p>
<p>This is to certify that I transcribed <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, <i>Lavengro</i>, and some other works of my husband
George Borrow, from the original manuscripts.&nbsp; A
considerable portion of the transcript of <i>Lavengro</i> was
lost at the printing-office where the work was printed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Mary
Borrow</span>.</p>
<p>Witness: Henrietta M., daughter of Mary Borrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It only remains here to state the melancholy fact once again
that <i>Lavengro</i>, great work of literature as it is now
universally acknowledged to be, was not &ldquo;the book of the
year.&rdquo;&nbsp; The three thousand copies of the first issue
took more than twenty years to sell, and it was not until 1872
that Mr. Murray resolved to issue a cheaper edition.&nbsp; The
time was not ripe for the cult of the open road, the zest for
&ldquo;the wind on the heath&rdquo; that our age shares so
keenly.</p>

<span class="smcap">A Visit to Cornish Kinsmen</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Borrow had been a normal man of
letters he would have been quite satisfied to settle down at
Oulton, in a comfortable home, with a devoted wife.&nbsp; The
question of money was no longer to worry him.&nbsp; He had
moreover a money-making gift, which made him independent in a
measure of his wife&rsquo;s fortune.&nbsp; From <i>The Bible in
Spain</i> he must have drawn a very considerable amount,
considerable, that is, for a man whose habits were always
somewhat penurious.&nbsp; <i>The Bible in Spain</i> would have
been followed up, were Borrow a quite other kind of man, by a
succession of books almost equally remunerative.&nbsp; Even for
one so prone to hate both books and bookmen there was always the
wind on the heath, the gypsy encampment, the now famous
&ldquo;broad,&rdquo; not then the haunt of innumerable
trippers.&nbsp; But Borrow ever loved wandering more than
writing.&nbsp; Almost immediately after his marriage&mdash;in
1840&mdash;he hinted to the Bible Society of a journey to China;
a year later, in June, 1841, he suggested to Lord Clarendon that
Lord Palmerston might give him a consulship: he consulted Hasfeld
as to a possible livelihood in Berlin, and Ford as to travel in
Africa.&nbsp; He seems to have endured residence at Oulton with
difficulty during the succeeding three years, and in 1844 we find
him engaged upon the continental travel that we have already
recorded.&nbsp; In 1847 he had hopes of the consulship at Canton,
but Bowring wanted it for himself, and a misunderstanding over
this led to an inevitable break of old friendship.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s passionate love of travel was never more to be
gratified at the expense of others.&nbsp; He tried, indeed, to
secure a journey to the East from the British Museum Trustees,
and then gave up the struggle.&nbsp; Further wanderings, which
were many, were to be confined to Europe and indeed to England,
Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man.&nbsp; His first journey,
however, was not at his own initiative.&nbsp; Mrs. Borrow&rsquo;s
health was unequal to the severe <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>winters at Oulton, and so the
Borrows made their home at Yarmouth from 1853 to 1860.&nbsp;
During these years he gave his vagabond propensities full
play.&nbsp; No year passed without its record of wandering.&nbsp;
His first expedition was the outcome of a burst of notoriety that
seems to have done for Borrow what the success of his <i>Bible in
Spain</i> could not do&mdash;reveal his identity to his Cornish
relations.&nbsp; The <i>Bury Post</i> of 17th September, 1853,
recorded that Borrow had at the risk of his life saved at least
one member of a boat&rsquo;s crew wrecked on the coast at
Yarmouth:</p>
<blockquote><p>The moment was an awful one, when George Borrow,
the well-known author of <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, dashed into the surf and saved one life, and through
his instrumentality the others were saved.&nbsp; We ourselves
have known this brave and gifted man for years, and, daring as
was his deed, we have known him more than once to risk his life
for others.&nbsp; We are happy to add that he has sustained no
material injury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph in the Bury St. Edmunds newspaper was copied
into the <i>Plymouth Mail</i>, and was there read by the Borrows
of Cornwall, who had heard nothing of their relative, Thomas
Borrow the army captain, and his family for fifty years or
more.&nbsp; One of Borrow&rsquo;s cousins by marriage, Robert
Taylor of Penquite, invited him to his father&rsquo;s homeland,
and Borrow accepted, glad, we may be sure, of any excuse for a
renewal of his wanderings.&nbsp; And so on the 23rd of December,
1853, Borrow made his way from Yarmouth to Plymouth by rail, and
thence walked twenty miles to Liskeard, where quite a little
party of Borrow&rsquo;s cousins were present to greet him.&nbsp;
The Borrow family consisted of Henry Borrow of Looe Down, the
father of Mrs. Taylor, William Borrow of Trethinnick, Thomas
Nicholas and Elizabeth Borrow, all first cousins, except Anne
Taylor.&nbsp; Anne, talking to a friend, describes Borrow on this
visit better than any one else has done:</p>
<blockquote><p>A fine tall man of about six feet three;
well-proportioned and not stout; able to walk five miles an hour
successively; rather florid face without any hirsute appendages;
hair white and soft; eyes and eyebrows dark; good nose and very
nice mouth; well-shaped hands;&mdash;altogether a person you
would notice in a crowd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow stayed at Penquite with his cousins from 24th <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>December to
9th January, then he went on a walking tour to Land&rsquo;s End,
through Truro and Penzance; he was back at Penquite from 26th
January to 1st February, and then took a week&rsquo;s tramp to
Tintagel, King Arthur&rsquo;s Castle, and Pentire.&nbsp;
Naturally he made inquiries into the language, already extinct,
but spoken within the memory of the older inhabitants.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My relations are most excellent people,&rdquo; he wrote to
his wife from London on his way back, &ldquo;but I could not
understand more than half of what they said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have only one letter to Mrs. Borrow written during this
tour:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. George Borrow</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Penquite</span>,
27<i>th</i> <i>Janry.</i> 1854.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I just write
you a line to inform you that I have got back safe here from the
Land&rsquo;s End.&nbsp; I have received your two letters, and
hope you received mine from the Land&rsquo;s End.&nbsp; It is
probable that I shall yet visit one or two places before I leave
Cornwall.&nbsp; I am very much pleased with the country.&nbsp;
When you receive this if you please write a line <i>by return of
post</i> I think you may; the Trethinnick people wish me to stay
with them for a day or two.&nbsp; When you see the Cobbs pray
remember me to them; I am sorry Horace has lost his aunt, he will
<i>miss her</i>.&nbsp; Love to Hen.&nbsp; Ever yours,
dearest,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">G.
Borrow</span>.</p>
<p>(Keep this.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the failure of <i>The Romany Rye</i> that prevented
Borrow from writing the Cornish book that he had caused to be
advertised in the flyleaf of that work.&nbsp; Borrow would have
made a beautiful book upon Cornwall.&nbsp; Even the title,
<i>Penquite and Pentyre</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>The Head of the Forest
and the Headland</i>, has music in it.&nbsp; And he had in these
twenty weeks made himself wonderfully well acquainted not only
with the topography of the principality, but with its folklore
and legend.&nbsp; The gulf that ever separated the Borrow of the
notebook and the unprepared letter from the Borrow of the
finished manuscript was extraordinary, and we may deplore with
Mr. Walling the absence of this among Borrow&rsquo;s many
unwritten books.</p>
<p>Borrow was back in Yarmouth at the end of February,
1854&mdash;he had not fled the country as Dalrymple had <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>suggested&mdash;but in July he was off again for his
great tour in Wales, in which he was accompanied by his wife and
daughter.&nbsp; Of that tour we must treat in another and later
chapter, for <i>Wild Wales</i> was not published until
1862.&nbsp; The year following his great tour in Wales he went on
a trip to the Isle of Man.</p>
<h2><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="smcap">In the Isle of Man</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> holiday which Borrow gave
himself the year following his visit to Wales, that is to say, in
September, 1855, is recorded in his unpublished diaries.&nbsp; He
never wrote a book as the outcome of that journey, although he
caused one to be advertised under the title of <i>Bayr Jairgey
and Glion Doo</i>: <i>Wanderings in Search of Manx
Literature</i>.&nbsp; Borrow, it will be remembered, learnt the
Irish language as a mere child, much to his father&rsquo;s
disgust.&nbsp; Although he never loved the Irish people, the
Celtic Irish, that is to say, whose genial temperament was so
opposed to his own, he did love the Irish language, which he more
than once declared had incited him to become a student of many
tongues.&nbsp; He never made the mistake into which so many have
fallen of calling it &ldquo;Erse.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was never an
accurate student of the Irish language, but among Englishmen he
led the way in the present-day interest in that tongue&mdash;an
interest which is now so pronounced among scholars of many
nationalities, and has made in Ireland so definite a revival of a
language that for a time seemed to be on the way to
extinction.&nbsp; Two translations from the Irish are to be found
in his <i>Targum</i> published so far back as 1835, and many
other translations from the Irish poets were among the
unpublished manuscripts that he left behind him.&nbsp; It would
therefore be with peculiar interest that he would visit the Isle
of Man which, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, was an
Irish-speaking land, but in 1855 was at a stage when the language
was falling fast into decay.&nbsp; What survived of it was still
Irish with trifling variations in the spelling of words.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cranu,&rdquo; a tree, for example, had become
&ldquo;Cwan,&rdquo; and so on&mdash;although the pronunciation
was apparently much the same.&nbsp; When the tall, white-haired
Englishman talked to the older inhabitants who knew something of
the language they were delighted.&nbsp; <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;Mercy upon us,&rdquo; said one old woman,
&ldquo;I believe, sir, you are of the old Manx!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Borrow was actually wandering in search of Manx literature, as
the title of the book that he announced implied.&nbsp; He
inquired about the old songs of the island, and of everything
that survived of its earlier language.&nbsp; Altogether Borrow
must have had a good time in thus following his favourite
pursuit.</p>
<p>But these stories are less human than a notebook in my
hands.&nbsp; This is a long leather pocket-book, in which, under
the title of &ldquo;Expedition to the Isle of Man,&rdquo; we
have, written in pencil, a quite vivacious account of his
adventures.&nbsp; It records that Borrow and his wife and
daughter set out through Bury to Peterborough, Rugby, and
Liverpool.&nbsp; It tells of the admiration with which
Peterborough&rsquo;s &ldquo;noble cathedral&rdquo; inspired
him.&nbsp; Liverpool he calls a &ldquo;London in
miniature&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Strolled about town with my wife and Henrietta;
wonderful docks and quays, where all the ships of the world
seemed to be gathered&mdash;all the commerce of the world to be
carried on; St. George&rsquo;s Crescent; noble shops; strange
people walking about, an Herculean mulatto, for example; the old
china shop; cups with Chinese characters upon them; an horrible
old Irishwoman with naked feet; Assize Hall a noble edifice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The party left Liverpool on 20th August, and Borrow, when in
sight of the Isle of Man, noticed a lofty ridge of mountains
rising to the clouds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Entered into conversation with two of the
crew&mdash;Manx sailors&mdash;about the Manx language; one, a
very tall man, said he knew only a very little of it as he was
born on the coast, but that his companion, who came from the
interior, knew it well; said it was a mere gibberish.&nbsp; This
I denied, and said it was an ancient language, and that it was
like the Irish; his companion, a shorter man, in shirt sleeves,
with a sharp, eager countenance, now opened his mouth and said I
was right, and said that I was the only gentleman whom he had
ever heard ask questions about the Manx language.&nbsp; I spoke
several Irish words which they understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he had landed he continued his investigations, asking
every peasant he met the Manx for this or that English word:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Are you Manx?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am Manx.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what do you call a river in Manx?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;A river,&rdquo; he <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you speak
Manx?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;I speak Manx.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you call a river a
river?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call it owen?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; I passed on, and
on the other side of the bridge went for some time along an
avenue of trees, passing by a stone water-mill, till I came to a
public-house on the left hand.&nbsp; Seeing a woman looking out
of the window, I asked her to what place the road led.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To Castletown,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
do you call the river in Manx?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
call it an owen,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I
thought,&rdquo; I replied, and after a little further discourse
returned, as the night was now coming fast on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One man whom Borrow asked if there were any poets in Man
replied that he did not believe there were, that the last Manx
poet had died some time ago at Kirk Conoshine, and this man had
translated Parnell&rsquo;s <i>Hermit</i> beautifully, and the
translation had been printed.&nbsp; He inquired about the Runic
Stones, which he continually transcribed.&nbsp; Under date
Thursday, 30th August, we find the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>This day year I ascended Snowdon, and this
morning, which is very fine, I propose to start on an expedition
to Castletown and to return by Peel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very gladly would I follow Borrow more in detail through this
interesting holiday by means of his diary, <a
name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197"
class="citation">[197]</a> but it would make my book too
long.&nbsp; As he had his wife and daughter with him there are no
letters by him from the island.</p>
<p>Three years later we find that Borrow has not forgotten the
friends of that Manx holiday.&nbsp; This letter is from the Vicar
of Malew in acknowledgment of a copy of <i>The Romany Rye</i>
published in the interval:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To

introduction to the new edition of the <i>Manx Grammar</i>.&nbsp;

to my purpose, and would be so interesting to every Manxman, that
I would fain insert the whole bodily, did the Author and the
limits of an Introduction permit.&nbsp; The <i>Grammar</i> will,
I think, go to press in March next.&nbsp; It is to be published

199</span>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="smcap">Oulton Broad and Yarmouth</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">George Borrow</span> wandered far and
wide, but he always retraced his footsteps to East Anglia, of
which he was so justly proud.&nbsp; From his marriage in 1840
until his death in 1881 he lived twenty-seven years at Oulton or
at Yarmouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is on sand alone that the sea
strikes its true music,&rdquo; Borrow once remarked,
&ldquo;Norfolk sand&rdquo;&mdash;and it was in the waves and on
the sands of the Norfolk coast that Borrow spent the happiest
hours of his restless life.&nbsp; Oulton Cottage is only about
two miles from Lowestoft, and so, walking or driving, these
places were quite near one another.&nbsp; But both are in
Suffolk.&nbsp; Was it because Yarmouth&mdash;ten miles
distant&mdash;is in Norfolk that it was always selected for
seaside residence?&nbsp; I suspect that the careful Mrs. Borrow
found a wider selection of &ldquo;apartments&rdquo; at a moderate
price.&nbsp; In any case the sea air of Yarmouth was good for his
wife, and the sea bathing was good for him, and so we find that
husband and wife had seven separate residences at Yarmouth during
the years of Oulton life. <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a>&nbsp; But Oulton
was ever to be Borrow&rsquo;s headquarters, even though between
1860 and 1874 he had a house in London.&nbsp; Borrow was
thirty-seven years of age when he settled down at Oulton.&nbsp;
He was, he tells us in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, &ldquo;in tolerably
easy circumstances and willing to take some rest after a life of
labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their home was a cottage on the Broad, for
the Hall, which was also Mrs. Borrow&rsquo;s property, was let on
lease to a farmer.&nbsp; The cottage, however, was an extremely
pleasant residence with a lawn running down to the river.&nbsp; A
more substantial house has been built on this site since
Borrow&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; The summer-house is generally assumed
to be the same, but has <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>certainly been re-roofed since the
time when Henrietta Clarke drew the picture of it that is
reproduced in this book.&nbsp; Probably the whole summer-house is
new, but at any rate the present structure stands on the site of
the old one.&nbsp; Here Borrow did his work, wrote and wrote and
wrote, until he had, as he said, &ldquo;mountains of
manuscripts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here first of all he completed <i>The
Zincali</i> (1841), commenced in Seville; then he wrote or rather
arranged <i>The Bible in Spain</i> (1843), and then at long
intervals, diversified by extensive travel holidays, he wrote
<i>Lavengro</i> (1851), <i>The Romany Rye</i> (1857), and <i>Wild
Wales</i> (1860)&mdash;these are the five books and their dates
that we most associate with Borrow&rsquo;s sojourn at
Oulton.&nbsp; When <i>Wild Wales</i> was published he had removed
to London.</p>
<p>By far the best glimpses of Borrow during these years of
Suffolk life are those contained in a letter contributed by his
friend, Elizabeth Harvey, to <i>The Eastern Daily Press</i> of
Norwich over the initials &ldquo;E. H.&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I knew Mr. Borrow he lived in a lovely
cottage whose garden sloped down to the edge of Oulton
Broad.&nbsp; He had a wooden room built on the very margin of the
water, where he had many strange old books in various
languages.&nbsp; I remember he once put one before me, telling me
to read it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;You ought, it&rsquo;s your own
language.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was an old Saxon book.&nbsp; He used to
spend a great deal of his time in this room writing, translating,
and at times singing strange words in a stentorian voice, while
passers-by on the lake would stop to listen with astonishment and
curiosity to the singular sounds.&nbsp; He was 6 feet 3 inches, a
splendid man, with handsome hands and feet.&nbsp; He wore neither
whiskers, beard, nor moustache.&nbsp; His features were very
handsome, but his eyes were peculiar, being round and rather
small, but very piercing, and now and then fierce.&nbsp; He would
sometimes sing one of his Romany songs, shake his fist at me and
look quite wild.&nbsp; Then he would ask, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
afraid of me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; I would
say.&nbsp; Then he would look just as gentle and kind, and say,
&ldquo;God bless you, I would not hurt a hair of your
head.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was an expert swimmer, and used to go out
bathing, and dive under water an immense time.&nbsp; On one
occasion he was bathing with a friend, and after plunging in
nothing was seen of him for some while.&nbsp; His friend began to
be alarmed, when he heard Borrow&rsquo;s voice a long way off
exclaiming, &ldquo;There, if that had been written in one of my
books they would have said it was a lie, wouldn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was very fond of animals, and the animals
were fond of him.&nbsp; He would go for a walk with two dogs and
a cat following him.&nbsp; The <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>cat would go a quarter of a mile or
so and then turn back home.&nbsp; He delighted to go for long
walks and enter into conversation with any one he might meet on
the road, and lead them into histories of their lives,
belongings, and experiences.&nbsp; When they used some word
peculiar to Norfolk (or Suffolk) countrymen he would say,
&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a Danish word.&rdquo;&nbsp; By and by
the man would use another peculiar expression, &ldquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s Saxon&rdquo;; a little later on another, &ldquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s French.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he would add, &ldquo;Why,
what a wonderful man you are to speak so many
languages.&rdquo;&nbsp; One man got very angry, but Mr. Borrow
was quite unconscious that he had given any offence.&nbsp; He
spoke a great number of languages, and at the Exhibition of 1851,
whither he went with his stepdaughter, he spoke to the different
foreigners in their own language, until his daughter saw some of
them whispering together and looking as if they thought he was
&ldquo;uncanny,&rdquo; and she became alarmed and drew him
away.&nbsp; He, however, did not like to hear the English
language adulterated with the introduction of foreign
words.&nbsp; If his wife or friends used a foreign word in
conversation, he would say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, trying to
come over me with strange languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have gone for many a walk with him at Oulton.&nbsp; He used
to go on, singing to himself or quite silent, quite forgetting me
until he came to a high hill, when he would turn round, seize my
hand, and drag me up.&nbsp; Then he would sit down and enjoy the
prospect.&nbsp; He was a great lover of nature, and very fond of
his trees.&nbsp; He quite fretted if, by some mischance, he lost
one.&nbsp; He did not shoot or hunt.&nbsp; He rode his Arab at
times, but walking was his favourite exercise.&nbsp; He was
subject to fits of nervous depression.&nbsp; At times also he
suffered from sleeplessness, when he would get up and walk to
Norwich (25 miles), and return the next night recovered.&nbsp;
His fondness for the gypsies has been noticed.&nbsp; At Oulton he
used to allow them to encamp in his grounds, and he would visit
them, with a friend or alone, talk to them in Romany, and sing
Romany songs.&nbsp; He was very fond of ghost stories and
believed in the supernatural.&nbsp; He was keenly sympathetic
with any one who was in trouble or suffering.&nbsp; He was no man
of business and very guileless, and led a very harmless, quiet
life at Oulton, spending his evenings at home with his wife and
step-daughter, generally reading all the evening.&nbsp; He was
very hospitable in his own home, and detested meanness.&nbsp; He
was moderate in eating and drinking, took very little breakfast,
but ate a very great quantity at dinner, and then had only a
draught of cold water before going to bed.&nbsp; He wrote much in
praise of &ldquo;strong ale,&rdquo; and was very fond of good
ale, of whose virtue he had a great idea.&nbsp; Once I was
speaking of a lady who was attached to a gentleman, and he asked,
&ldquo;Well, did he make her an offer?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;if she had given him some good ale he would.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But although he talked so much about ale I never saw him take
much.&nbsp; He was very temperate, and would eat what was set
before him, often not thinking of what <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>he was
doing, and he never refused what was offered him.&nbsp; He took
much pleasure in music, especially of a light and lively
character.&nbsp; My sister would sing to him, and I played.&nbsp;
One piece he seemed never to tire of hearing.&nbsp; It was a
polka, &ldquo;The Redowa,&rdquo; I think, and when I had finished
he used to say, &ldquo;Play that again, E&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was very polite and gentlemanly in ladies&rsquo; society, and we
all liked him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is refreshing to read this tribute, from which I have
omitted nothing salient, because a very disagreeable Borrow has
somehow grown up into a tradition.&nbsp; I note in reading some
of the reviews of Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s <i>Life</i> that he is
charged, or half-charged, with suppressing facts, &ldquo;because
they do not reflect credit upon the subject of his
biography.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, there were really no facts to
suppress.&nbsp; Borrow was at times a very irritable man, he was
a very self-centred one.&nbsp; His egotism might even be
pronounced amazing by those who had never met an author.&nbsp;
But those of us who have, recognise that with very few exceptions
they are all egotists, although some conceal it from the
unobservant more deftly than others.&nbsp; Many authors of power
have died young and unrecognised; but recognition has usually
come to those men of genius who have lived into middle age.&nbsp;
It did not come to Borrow.&nbsp; He had therefore a right to be
soured.&nbsp; This sourness found expression in many ways.&nbsp;
Borrow, most sound of churchmen, actually quarrelled with his
vicar over the tempers of their respective dogs.&nbsp; Both the
vicar, the Rev. Edwin Proctor Denniss, and his parishioner wrote
one another acrid letters.&nbsp; Here is Borrow&rsquo;s parting
shot:</p>
<blockquote><p>Circumstances over which Mr. Borrow has at present
no control will occasionally bring him and his family under the
same roof with Mr. Denniss; that roof, however, is the roof of
the House of God, and the prayers of the Church of England are
wholesome from whatever mouth they may proceed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely that is a kind of quarrel we have all had in our day,
and we think ourselves none the less virtuous in
consequence.&nbsp; Then there was Borrow&rsquo;s very natural
ambition to be made a magistrate of Suffolk.&nbsp; He tells Mr.
John Murray in 1842 that he has caught a bad cold by getting up
at night in pursuit of poachers and thieves.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
terrible neighbourhood this,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;not a
magistrate dare do <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>his duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so in the next year he wrote
again to the same correspondent:</p>
<blockquote><p>Present my compliments to Mr. Gladstone, and tell
him that the <i>Bible in Spain</i> will have no objection to
becoming one of the &ldquo;Great Unpaid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gladstone, although he had admired <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, and indeed had even suggested the modification of one
of its sentences, did nothing.&nbsp; Lockhart, Lord Clarendon,
and others who were applied to were equally powerless or
indifferent.&nbsp; Borrow never got his magistracy.&nbsp; To-day
no man of equal eminence in literature could possibly have failed
of so slight an ambition.&nbsp; Moreover, Borrow wanted to be a
J.P., not from mere snobbery as many might, but for a definite,
practical object.&nbsp; I am afraid he would not have made a very
good magistrate, and perhaps inquiry had made that clear to the
authorities.&nbsp; Lastly, there was Borrow&rsquo;s quarrel with
the railway which came through his estate.&nbsp; He had thoughts
of removing to Bury, where Dr. Hake lived, or to Troston Hall,
once the home of the interesting Capell Lofft.&nbsp; But he was
not to leave Oulton.&nbsp; In intervals of holidays, journeys,
and of sojourn in Yarmouth it was to remain his home to the
end.&nbsp; In 1849 his mother joined him at Oulton.&nbsp; She had
resided for thirty-three years at the Willow Lane Cottage.&nbsp;
She was now seventy-seven years of age.&nbsp; She lived on near
her son as a tenant of his tenant at Oulton Hall until her death
nine years later, dying in 1858 in her eighty-seventh year.&nbsp;
She lies buried in Oulton Churchyard, with a tomb thus
inscribed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sacred to the memory of Ann Borrow, widow of
Captain Thomas Borrow.&nbsp; She died on the 16th of August 1858,
aged eighty-six years and seven months.&nbsp; She was a good wife
and a good mother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During these years at Oulton we have many glimpses of
Borrow.&nbsp; Dr. Jessopp, for example, has recorded in <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i> newspaper his own hero-worship for the author
of <i>Lavengro</i>, whom he was never to meet.&nbsp; This
enthusiasm for <i>Lavengro</i> was shared by certain of his
Norfolk friends of those days:</p>
<blockquote><p>Among those friends were two who, I believe, are
still alive, and who about the year 1846 set out, without telling
me of <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>their intention, on a pilgrimage to Oulton to see
George Borrow in the flesh.&nbsp; In those days the journey was
not an inconsiderable one; and though my friends must have known
that I would have given my ears to be of the party, I suppose
they kept their project to themselves for reasons of their
own.&nbsp; Two, they say, are company and three are none; two men
could ride in a gig for sixty miles without much difficulty, and
an odd man often spoils sport.&nbsp; At any rate, they left me
out, and one day they came back full of malignant pride and joy
and exultation, and they flourished their information before me
with boastings and laughter at my ferocious jealousy; for they
had seen, and talked with, and eaten and drunk with, and sat at
the feet of the veritable George Borrow, and had grasped his
mighty hand.&nbsp; To me it was too provoking.&nbsp; But what had
they to tell?</p>
<p>They found him at Oulton, living, as they affirmed, in a house
which belonged to Mrs. Borrow and which her first husband had
left her.&nbsp; The household consisted of himself, his wife, and
his wife&rsquo;s daughter; and among his other amusements he
employed himself in training some young horses to follow him
about like dogs and come at the call of his whistle.&nbsp; As my
two friends were talking with him Borrow sounded his whistle in a
paddock near the house, which, if I remember rightly, was
surrounded by a low wall.&nbsp; Immediately two beautiful horses
came bounding over the fence and trotted up to their
master.&nbsp; One put his nose into Borrow&rsquo;s outstretched
hand and the other kept snuffing at his pockets in expectation of
the usual bribe for confidence and good behaviour.&nbsp; Borrow
could not but be flattered by the young Cambridge men paying him
the frank homage they offered, and he treated them with the
robust and cordial hospitality characteristic of the man.&nbsp;
One or two things they learnt which I do not feel at liberty to
repeat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Arthur W. Upcher of Sheringham Hall, Cromer, also provided
in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> a quaint reminiscence of Borrow in
which he recalled that Lavengro had called upon Miss Anna
Gurney.&nbsp; This lady had, assuredly with less guile, treated
him much as Frances Cobbe would have done.&nbsp; She had taken
down an Arabic grammar, and put it into his hand, asking for
explanation of some difficult point which he tried to decipher;
but meanwhile she talked to him continuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
could not,&rdquo; said Borrow, &ldquo;study the Arabic grammar
and listen to her at the same time, so I threw down the book and
ran out of the room.&rdquo;&nbsp; He soon after met Mr. Upcher,
to whom he made an interesting revelation:</p>
<blockquote><p>He told us there were three personages in the
world whom <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>he had always a desire to see; two of these had slipped
through his fingers, so he was determined to see the third.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pray, Mr. Borrow, who were they?&rdquo;&nbsp; He held up
three fingers of his left hand and pointed them off with the
forefinger of the right: the first Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, the
second Lamplighter (the sire of Phosphorus, Lord Berners&rsquo;s
winner of the Derby), the third, Anna Gurney.&nbsp; The first two
were dead and he had not seen them; now he had come to see Anna
Gurney, and this was the end of his visit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At one moment of the correspondence we obtain an interesting
glimpse of a great man of science.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin sent the
following inquiry through Dr. Hooker, afterwards Sir Joseph
Hooker, and it reached Borrow through his friend Thomas
Brightwell:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there any Dog in Spain closely like our English
Pointer, in <i>shape</i> and size, and
<i>habits</i>,&mdash;namely in pointing, backing, and not giving
tongue.&nbsp; Might I be permitted to quote Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s
answer to the query?&nbsp; Has the improved English pointer been
introduced into Spain?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">C.
Darwin</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow took constant holidays during these Oulton days.&nbsp;
We have elsewhere noted his holidays in Eastern Europe, in the
Isle of Man, in Wales, and in Cornwall.&nbsp; Letters from other
parts of England would be welcome, but I can only find two, and
these are but scraps.&nbsp; Both are addressed to his wife, each
without date:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To

</blockquote>
<p>One of the very last letters of Borrow that I possess is to an
unknown correspondent.&nbsp; It is from a rough
&ldquo;draft&rdquo; in his handwriting:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Oulton</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>, <i>May</i> 1875.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the
eighth of March I only lately received, otherwise I should have
answered it sooner.&nbsp; In it you mention Chamberlayne&rsquo;s
work, containing versions of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer translated
into a hundred languages, and ask whether I can explain why the
one which purports to be a rendering into Waldensian is evidently
made in some dialect of the Gaelic.&nbsp; To such explanation as
I can afford you are welcome, though perhaps you will not deem it
very satisfactory.&nbsp; I have been acquainted with
Chamberlayne&rsquo;s work for upwards of forty years.&nbsp; I
first saw it at St. Petersburg in 1834, and the translation in
question very soon caught my attention.&nbsp; I at first thought
that it was an attempt at imposition, but I soon relinquished
that idea.&nbsp; I remembered that Helvetia was a great place for
Gaelic.&nbsp; I do not mean in the old time when the Gael
possessed the greater part of Europe, but at a long subsequent
period: Switzerland was converted to Christianity by Irish monks,
the most active and efficient of whom was Gall.&nbsp; These
people founded schools in which together with Christianity the
Irish or Gaelic language was taught.&nbsp; In process of time,
though the religion flourished, the Helveto Gaelic died away, but
many pieces in that tongue survived, some of which might still
probably be found in the recesses of St. Gall.&nbsp; The noble
abbey is named after the venerable apostle of Christianity in
Helvetia; so I deemed it very possible that the version in
question might be one of the surviving fruits of Irish missionary
labour in Helvetia, not but that I had my doubts, and still have,
principally from observing that the language though certainly not
modern does not exhibit any decided marks of high
antiquity.&nbsp; It is much to be regretted that Chamberlayne
should have given the version to the world under a title so
calculated to perplex and mislead as that which it bears, and
without even stating how or where he obtained it.&nbsp; This,
sir, is all I have to say on the very obscure subject about which
you have done me the honour to consult me.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<h2><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="smcap">In Scotland and Ireland</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> has himself given
us&mdash;in <i>Lavengro</i>&mdash;a picturesque record of his
early experiences in Scotland.&nbsp; It is passing strange that
he published no account of his two visits to the North in maturer
years.&nbsp; Why did he not write <i>Wild Scotland</i> as a
companion volume to <i>Wild Wales</i>?&nbsp; He preserved in
little leather pocket-books or leather-covered exercise-books
copious notes of both tours.&nbsp; Two of his notebooks came into
the possession of the late Dr. Knapp, Borrow&rsquo;s first
biographer, and are thus described in his Bibliography:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Note Book of a Tour in Scotland</i>, <i>the
Orkneys and Shetland in Oct. and Dec.</i> 1858.&nbsp; 1 large
vol. leather.</p>
<p><i>Note Book of Tours around Belfast and the Scottish Borders
from Stranraer to Berwick-upon-Tweed in July and August</i>
1866.&nbsp; 1 vol. leather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of these Dr. Knapp made use only to give the routes of
Borrow&rsquo;s journeys so far as he was able to interpret
them.&nbsp; It may be that he was doubtful as to whether his
purchase of the manuscript carried with it the copyright of its
contents, as it assuredly did not; it may be that he quailed
before the minute and almost undecipherable handwriting.&nbsp;
But similar notebooks are in my possession, and there are,
happily, in these days typists&mdash;you pay them by the hour,
and it means an infinity of time and patience&mdash;who will copy
the most minute and the most obscure documents.&nbsp; There are
some of the notebooks of the Scottish tour of 1858 before me, and
what is of far more importance&mdash;Borrow&rsquo;s letters to
his wife while on this tour.&nbsp; Borrow lost his mother in
August, 1858, and this event was naturally a great blow to his
heart.&nbsp; A week or two later he suffered a cruel blow to his
pride also, nothing less than the return of the manuscript of his
much-prized translation from the Welsh of <i>The Sleeping
Bard</i>&mdash;and this by his &ldquo;prince of <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>publishers,&rdquo; John Murray.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
no money in it,&rdquo; said the publisher, and he was doubtless
right.&nbsp; The two disasters were of different character, but
both unhinged him.&nbsp; He had already written <i>Wild
Wales</i>, although it was not to be published for another four
years.&nbsp; He had caused to be advertised&mdash;in 1857&mdash;a
book on Cornwall, but it was never written in any definitive
form, and now our author had lost heart, and the Cornish
book&mdash;<i>Penquite and Pentyre</i>&mdash;and the Scots book
never saw the light.&nbsp; In these autumn months of 1858
geniality and humour had parted from Borrow; this his diary makes
clear.&nbsp; He was ill.&nbsp; His wife urged a tour in Scotland,
and he prepared himself for a rough, simple journey, of a kind
quite different from the one in Wales.&nbsp; The north of
Scotland in the winter was scarcely to be thought of for his wife
and step-daughter Henrietta.&nbsp; He tells us in one of these
diaries that he walked &ldquo;several hundred miles in the
Highlands.&rdquo;&nbsp; His wife and daughter were with him in
Wales, as every reader of <i>Wild Wales</i> will recall, but the
Scots tour was meant to be a more formidable pilgrimage, and they
went to Great Yarmouth instead.&nbsp; The first half of the
tour&mdash;that of September&mdash;is dealt with in letters to
his wife, the latter half is reflected in his diary.&nbsp; The
letters show Borrow&rsquo;s experiences in the earlier part of
his journey, and from his diaries we learn that he was in Oban on
22nd October, Aberdeen on 5th November, Inverness on the 9th, and
thence he went to Tain, Dornoch, Wick, John o&rsquo;
Groat&rsquo;s, and to the island towns, Stromness, Kirkwall, and
Lerwick.&nbsp; He was in Shetland on the 1st of
December&mdash;altogether a bleak, cheerless journey, we may
believe, even for so hardy a tramp as Borrow, and the tone of the
following extract from one of his rough notebooks in my
possession may perhaps be explained by the circumstance.&nbsp;
Borrow is on the way to Loch Laggan and visits a desolate
churchyard, Coll Harrie, to see the tomb of John Macdonnel or Ian
Lom:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was on a Highland hill in an old Popish
burying-ground.&nbsp; I entered the ruined church, disturbed a
rabbit crouching under an old tombstone&mdash;it ran into a hole,
then came out running about like wild&mdash;quite
frightened&mdash;made room for it to run out by the doorway,
telling it I would not hurt it&mdash;went out again and examined
the tombs. . . .&nbsp; Would have <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>examined much more but the wind and
rain blew horribly, and I was afraid that my hat, if not my head,
would be blown into the road over the hill.&nbsp; Quitted the
place of old Highland Popish devotion&mdash;descended the hill
again with great difficulty&mdash;grass slippery and the ground
here and there quaggy, resumed the road&mdash;village&mdash;went
to the door of house looking down the valley&mdash;to ask its
name&mdash;knock&mdash;people came out, a whole family, looking
sullen and all savage.&nbsp; The stout, tall young man with the
grey savage eyes&mdash;civil questions&mdash;half-savage
answers&mdash;village&rsquo;s name Achaluarach&mdash;the
neighbourhood&mdash;all Catholic&mdash;chiefly Macdonnels; said
the English, <i>my countrymen</i>, had taken the whole
country&mdash;&ldquo;but not without paying for it,&rdquo; I
replied&mdash;said I was soaking wet with a kind of sneer, but
never asked me in.&nbsp; I said I cared not for wet.&nbsp; A
savage, brutal Papist and a hater of the English&mdash;the whole
family with bad countenances&mdash;a tall woman in the background
probably the mother of them all.&nbsp; Bade him good-day, he made
no answer and I went away.&nbsp; Learnt that the river&rsquo;s
name was Spean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He passed through Scotland in a disputative vein, which could
not have made him a popular traveller.&nbsp; He tells a Roman
Catholic of the Macdonnel clan to read his Bible and &ldquo;trust
in Christ, not in the Virgin Mary and graven images.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He went up to another man who accosted him with the remark that
&ldquo;It is a soft day,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;You should not
say a &lsquo;soft&rsquo; day, but a wet day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even
the Spanish, for whom he had so much contempt and scorn when he
returned from the Peninsula, are &ldquo;in many things a wise
people&rdquo;&mdash;after his experiences of the Scots.&nbsp;
There is abundance of Borrow&rsquo;s prejudice, intolerance, and
charm in this fragment of a diary; but the extract I have given
is of additional interest as showing how Borrow wrote all his
books.&nbsp; The notebooks that he wrote in Spain and Wales were
made up of similar disjointed jottings.&nbsp; Here is a note of
more human character interspersed with Borrow&rsquo;s diatribes
upon the surliness of the Scots.&nbsp; He is at Invergarry, on
the banks of Loch Oich.&nbsp; It is the 5th of October:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dinner of real haggis; meet a conceited
schoolmaster.&nbsp; This night, or rather in the early morning, I
saw in the dream of my sleep my dear departed mother&mdash;she
appeared to be coming out of her little sleeping-room at Oulton
Hall&mdash;overjoyed I gave a cry and fell down at her knee, but
my agitation was so great that it burst the bonds of sleep, and I
awoke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the letters to Mrs. Borrow are the essential documents <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>here, and
not the copious diaries which I hope to publish elsewhere.&nbsp;
The first letter to &ldquo;Carreta&rdquo; is from Edinburgh,
where Borrow arrived on Sunday, 19th September, 1858:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. George Borrow</span>, 38 <span class="smcap">Camperdown
Place</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Yarmouth</span>, <span
class="smcap">Norfolk</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <i>Sunday</i> (<i>Sept.</i>
19<i>th</i>, 1858).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I just write a
line to inform you that I arrived here yesterday quite
safe.&nbsp; We did not start from Yarmouth till past three
o&rsquo;clock on Thursday morning; we reached Newcastle about ten
on Friday.&nbsp; As I was walking in the street at Newcastle a
sailor-like man came running up to me, and begged that I would
let him speak to me.&nbsp; He appeared almost wild with
joy.&nbsp; I asked him who he was, and he told me he was a
Yarmouth north beach man, and that he knew me very well.&nbsp;
Before I could answer, another sailor-like, short, thick fellow
came running up, who also seemed wild with joy; he was a comrade
of the other.&nbsp; I never saw two people so out of themselves
with pleasure, they literally danced in the street; in fact, they
were two of my old friends.&nbsp; I asked them how they came down
there, and they told me that they had been down fishing.&nbsp;
They begged a thousand pardons for speaking to me, but told me
they could not help it.&nbsp; I set off for Alnwick on Friday
afternoon, stayed there all night, and saw the castle next
morning.&nbsp; It is a fine old place, but at present is
undergoing repairs&mdash;a Scottish king was killed before its
walls in the old time.&nbsp; At about twelve I started for
Edinburgh.&nbsp; The place is wonderfully altered since I was
here, and I don&rsquo;t think for the better.&nbsp; There is a
Runic stone on the castle brae which I am going to copy.&nbsp; It
was not there in my time.&nbsp; If you write direct to me at the
Post Office, Inverness.&nbsp; I am thinking of going to Glasgow
to-morrow, from which place I shall start for Inverness by one of
the packets which go thither by the North-West and the Caledonian
Canal.&nbsp; I hope that you and Hen. are well and
comfortable.&nbsp; Pray eat plenty of grapes and
partridges.&nbsp; We had upon the whole a pleasant passage from
Yarmouth; we lived plainly but well, and I was not at all
ill&mdash;the captain seemed a kind, honest creature.&nbsp;
Remember me kindly to Mrs. Turnour and Mrs. Clarke, and God bless
you and Hen.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his unpublished diary Borrow records his journey from
Glasgow through beautiful but over-described scenery to
Inverness, where he stayed at the Caledonian Hotel:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span><span
class="smcap">To Mrs. George Borrow</span>, 38 <span
class="smcap">Camperdown Place</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Yarmouth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Inverness</span>, <i>Sunday</i> (<i>Sept.</i>
26th).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;This is the
third letter which I have written to you.&nbsp; Whether you have
received the other two, or will receive this, I am
doubtful.&nbsp; I have been several times to the post office, but
we found no letter from you, though I expected to find one
awaiting me when I arrived.&nbsp; I wrote last on Friday.&nbsp; I
merely want to know once how you are, and if all is well I shall
move onward.&nbsp; It is of not much use staying here.&nbsp;
After I had written to you on Friday I crossed by the ferry over
the Firth and walked to Beauly, and from thence to Beaufort or
Castle Downie; at Beauly I saw the gate of the pit where old
Fraser used to put the people whom he owed money to&mdash;it is
in the old ruined cathedral, and at Beaufort saw the ruins of the
house where he was born.&nbsp; Lord Lovat lives in the house
close by.&nbsp; There is now a claimant to the title, a
descendant of Old Fraser&rsquo;s elder brother who committed a
murder in the year 1690, and on that account fled to South
Wales.&nbsp; The present family are rather uneasy, and so are
their friends, of whom they have a great number, for though they
are flaming Papists they are very free of their money.&nbsp; I
have told several of their cousins that the claimant has not a
chance as the present family have been so long in
possession.&nbsp; They almost blessed me for saying so.&nbsp;
There, however, can be very little doubt that the title and
estate, more than a million acres, belong to the claimant by
strict law.&nbsp; Old Fraser&rsquo;s brother was called Black
John of the Tasser.&nbsp; The man whom he killed was a piper who
sang an insulting song to him at a wedding.&nbsp; I have heard
the words and have translated them; he was dressed very finely,
and the piper sang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dressed in Highland robes, O John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ropes of straw would become ye better;<br />
You&rsquo;ve silver buckles your shoes upon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But leather thongs for them were fitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon John drew his dagger and ran it into the
piper&rsquo;s belly; the descendants of the piper are still
living at Beauly.&nbsp; I walked that day thirty-four miles
between noon and ten o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; My letter of
credit is here.&nbsp; This is a dear place, but not so bad as
Edinburgh.&nbsp; <i>If you have written</i>, don&rsquo;t write
any more till you hear from me again.&nbsp; God bless you and
Hen.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Swindled out of a shilling by rascally ferryman,&rdquo;
is Borrow&rsquo;s note in his diary of the episode that he
relates to his wife of crossing the Firth.&nbsp; He does not tell
her, but <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>his diary tells us, that he changed his inn on the day
he wrote this letter: the following jottings from the diary cover
the period:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Sept.</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Quit the

</blockquote>
<p>But to return to Borrow&rsquo;s letters to his wife:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. George Borrow</span>, 38 <span class="smcap">Camperdown
Terrace</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Gt. Yarmouth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Inverness</span>, <i>September</i> 29<i>th</i>,
1858.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I have got
your letter, and glad enough I was to get it.&nbsp; The day after
to-morrow I shall depart from here for Fort Augustus at some
distance up the lake.&nbsp; After staying a few days there, I am
thinking of going to the Isle of Mull, but I will write to you if
possible from Fort Augustus.&nbsp; I am rather sorry that I came
to Scotland&mdash;I was never in such a place in my life for
cheating and imposition, and the farther north you go the worse
things seem to be, and yet I believe it is possible to live very
cheap here, that is if you have a house of your own and a wife to
go out and make bargains, for things are abundant enough, but if
you move about you are at the mercy of innkeepers and suchlike
people.&nbsp; The other day I was swindled out of a shilling by a
villain to whom I had given it for change.&nbsp; I ought,
perhaps, to have had him up before a magistrate provided I could
have found one, but I was in a wild place and he had a clan about
him, and if I had had him up I have no doubt I should have been
out-sworn.&nbsp; I, however, have met one fine, noble old
fellow.&nbsp; The other night I lost my way amongst horrible
moors and wandered for miles and miles without seeing a
soul.&nbsp; At last I saw a light which came from the window of a
rude hovel.&nbsp; I tapped <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>at the window and shouted, and at
last an old man came out; he asked me what I wanted, and I told
him I had lost my way.&nbsp; He asked me where I came from and
where I wanted to go, and on my telling him he said I had indeed
lost my way, for I had got out of it at least four miles, and was
going away from the place I wanted to get to.&nbsp; He then said
he would show me the way, and went with me several miles over
most horrible places.&nbsp; At last we came to a road where he
said he thought he might leave me, and wished me
good-night.&nbsp; I gave him a shilling.&nbsp; He was very
grateful and said, after considering, that as I had behaved so
handsomely to him he would not leave me yet, as he thought it
possible I might yet lose my way.&nbsp; He then went with me
three miles farther, and I have no doubt that, but for him, I
should have lost my way again, the roads were so tangled.&nbsp; I
never saw such an old fellow, or one whose conversation was so
odd and entertaining.&nbsp; This happened last Monday night, the
night of the day in which I had been swindled of the shilling by
the other; I could write a history about those two shillings.</p>

for Murray. . . .&nbsp; I met to-day a very fat gentleman from
Caithness, at the very north of Scotland; he said he was
descended from the Norse.&nbsp; I talked to him about them, and
he was so pleased with my conversation that he gave me his card,

could do no less, I showed him my card&mdash;I had but
one&mdash;and he no sooner saw the name than he was in a

copied the Runic stone on the Castle Hill, Edinburgh.&nbsp; It
was brought from Denmark in the old time.&nbsp; The inscription
is imperfect, but I can read enough of it to see that it was

high.&nbsp; I was nearly up to my middle in snow.&nbsp; As soon
as I had passed it I was in Badenoch.&nbsp; The road on the
farther side was horrible, and I was obliged to wade several
rivulets, one of which was very boisterous and nearly threw me
down.&nbsp; I wandered through a wonderful country, and picked up
a great many strange legends from the people I met, but they were
very few, the country being almost a desert, chiefly inhabited by
deer.&nbsp; When amidst the lower mountains I frequently heard
them blaring in the woods above me.&nbsp; The people at the inn
here are by far the nicest I have met; they are kind and
honourable to a degree.&nbsp; God bless you and Hen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;After I wrote
to you I walked round Mull and through it, over Benmore.&nbsp; I
likewise went to Icolmkill, and passed twenty-four hours
there.&nbsp; I saw the wonderful ruin and crossed the
island.&nbsp; I suffered a great deal from hunger, but what I saw
amply repaid me; on my return to Tobermory I was rather unwell,
but got better.&nbsp; I was disappointed in a passage to Thurso
by sea, so I was obliged to return to this place by train.&nbsp;
On Tuesday, <span class="smcap">D.V.</span>, I shall set out on
foot, and hope to find your letter awaiting me at the post office
at Thurso.&nbsp; On coming hither by train I nearly lost my
things.&nbsp; I was told at Huntly that the train stopped ten
minutes, and meanwhile the train drove off <i>purposely</i>; I
telegraphed to Keith in order that my things might be secured,
describing where they were, under the seat.&nbsp; The reply was
that there was nothing of the kind there.&nbsp; I instantly said
that I would bring an action against the company, and walked off
to the town, where I stated the facts to a magistrate, and gave
him my name and address.&nbsp; He advised me to bring my
action.&nbsp; I went back and found the people frightened.&nbsp;
They telegraphed again&mdash;and the reply was that the things
were safe.&nbsp; There is nothing like setting oneself up
sometimes.&nbsp; I was terribly afraid I should never again find
my books and things.&nbsp; I, however, got them, and my old
umbrella, too.&nbsp; I was sent on by the mail train, but lost
four hours, besides undergoing a great deal of misery and
excitement.&nbsp; When I have been to Thurso and Kirkwall I shall
return as quick as possible, and shall be glad to get out of the
country.&nbsp; As I am here, however, I wish to see all I can,
for I never wish to return.&nbsp; Whilst in Mull I lived very
cheaply&mdash;it is not costing me more than seven shillings a
day.&nbsp; The generality of the inns, however, in the lowlands
are incredibly dear&mdash;half-a-crown for breakfast, consisting
of a little tea, a couple of small eggs, and bread and
butter&mdash;<i>two</i> shillings for attendance.&nbsp; Tell Hen.
that I have some moss for her from Benmore&mdash;also some
seaweed from the farther shore of Icolmkill.&nbsp; God bless
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I reached
this place on Friday night, and was glad enough to get your kind
letter.&nbsp; I shall be so glad to get home to you.&nbsp; Since
my last letter to you I have walked nearly 160 miles.&nbsp; I was
terribly taken in with respect to distances&mdash;however, I
managed to make my way.&nbsp; I have been to Johnny Groat&rsquo;s
House, which is about twenty-two miles from this place.&nbsp; I
had tolerably fine weather all the way, but <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>within two
or three miles of that place a terrible storm arose; the next day
the country was covered with ice and snow.&nbsp; There is at
present here a kind of Greenland winter, colder almost than I
ever knew the winter in Russia.&nbsp; The streets are so covered
with ice that it is dangerous to step out; to-morrow D. and I
pass over into Orkney, and we shall take the first steamer to
Aberdeen and Inverness, from whence I shall make the best of my
way to England.&nbsp; It is well that I have no farther to walk,
for walking now is almost impossible&mdash;the last twenty miles
were terrible, and the weather is worse now than it was
then.&nbsp; I was terribly deceived with respect to
steamboats.&nbsp; I was told that one passed over to Orkney every
day, and I have now been waiting two days, and there is not yet
one.&nbsp; I have had quite enough of Scotland.&nbsp; When I was
at Johnny Groat&rsquo;s I got a shell for dear Hen, which I hope
I shall be able to bring or send to her.&nbsp; I am glad to hear
that you have got out the money on the mortgage so
satisfactorily.&nbsp; One of the greatest blessings in this world
is to be independent.&nbsp; My spirits of late have been rather
bad, owing principally to my dear mother&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I
always knew that we should miss her.&nbsp; I dreamt about her at
Fort Augustus.&nbsp; Though I have walked so much I have suffered
very little from fatigue, and have got over the ground with
surprising facility, but I have not enjoyed the country so much
as Wales.&nbsp; I wish that you would order a hat for me against
I come home; the one I am wearing is very shabby, having been so
frequently drenched with rain and storm-beaten.&nbsp; I cannot
say the exact day that I shall be home but you may be expecting
me.&nbsp; The worst is that there is no depending on the
steamers, for there is scarcely any traffic in Scotland in
winter.&nbsp; My appetite of late has been very poorly, chiefly,
I believe, owing to badness of food and want of regular
meals.&nbsp; Glad enough, I repeat, shall I be to get home to you
and Hen.</p>

see, in Orkney, and I expect every minute the steamer which will
take me to Shetland and Aberdeen, from which last place I go by
train to Inverness, where my things are, and thence home.&nbsp; I
had a stormy passage to Stromness, from whence I took a boat to
the Isle of Hoy, where I saw the wonderful Dwarf&rsquo;s House
hollowed out of the stone.&nbsp; From Stromness I walked
here.&nbsp; I have seen the old Norwegian Cathedral; it is of red
sandstone, and looks as if cut out of rock.&nbsp; It is different
from almost everything of the kind I ever saw.&nbsp; It is stern
and grand to a degree.&nbsp; I have also seen the ruins of the
old Norwegian Bishop&rsquo;s palace in which King Hacon died;
also the ruins of the palace of Patrick, Earl of Orkney.&nbsp; I
have been treated here with every kindness <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>and
civility.&nbsp; As soon as the people knew who I was they could
scarcely make enough of me.&nbsp; The Sheriff, Mr. Robertson, a
great Gaelic scholar, said he was proud to see me in his house;
and a young gentleman of the name of Petrie, Clerk of Supply, has
done nothing but go about with me to show me the wonders of the
place.&nbsp; Mr. Robertson wished to give me letters to some
gentleman at Edinburgh.&nbsp; I, however, begged leave to be
excused, saying that I wished to get home, as, indeed, I do, for
my mind is wearied by seeing so many strange places.&nbsp; On my
way to Kirkwall I saw the stones of Stennis&mdash;immense blocks
of stone standing up like those of Salisbury Plain.&nbsp; All the
country is full of Druidical and Pictish remains.&nbsp; It is,
however, very barren, and scarcely a tree is to be seen, only a
few dwarf ones.&nbsp; Orkney consists of a multitude of small
islands, the principal of which is Pomona, in which Kirkwall
is.&nbsp; The currents between them are terrible.&nbsp; I hope to
be home a few days after you receive these lines, either by rail
or steamer.&nbsp; This is a fine day, but there has been dreadful
weather here.&nbsp; I hope we shall have a prosperous
passage.&nbsp; I have purchased a little Kirkwall newspaper,
which I send you with this letter.&nbsp; I shall perhaps post
both at Lerwick or Aberdeen.&nbsp; I sent you a Johnny
Groat&rsquo;s newspaper, which I hope you got.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
tear either up, for they are curious.&nbsp; God bless you and
Hen.</p>

Edinburgh.&nbsp; I got to Aberdeen, where I posted a letter for
you.&nbsp; I was then obliged to return to Inverness for my
luggage&mdash;125 miles.&nbsp; Rather than return again to
Aberdeen, I sent on my things to Dunkeld and walked the 102 miles
through the Highlands.&nbsp; When I got here I walked to Loch
Lomond and Loch Katrine, thirty-eight miles over horrible
roads.&nbsp; I then got back here.&nbsp; I have now seen the
whole of Scotland that is worth seeing, and walked 600
miles.&nbsp; I shall be glad to be out of the country; a person
here must depend entirely upon himself and his own legs.&nbsp; I
have not spent much money&mdash;my expenses during my wanderings
averaged a shilling a day.&nbsp; As I was walking through
Strathspey, singularly enough I met two or three of the
Phillips.&nbsp; I did not know them, but a child came running
after me to ask <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>In spite of Borrow&rsquo;s vow never to visit Scotland again,
he was there eight years later&mdash;in 1866&mdash;but only in
the Lowlands.&nbsp; His stepdaughter, Hen., or Henrietta Clarke,
had married Dr. MacOubrey, of Belfast, and Borrow and his wife
went on a visit to the pair.&nbsp; But the incorrigible vagabond
in Borrow was forced to declare itself, and leaving his wife and
daughter in Belfast he crossed to Stranraer by steamer on 17th
July, 1866, and tramped through the lowlands, visiting
Ecclefechan and Gretna Green.&nbsp; We have no record of his
experiences at these places.&nbsp; The only literary impression
of the Scots tour of 1866, apart from a brief reference in Dr.
Knapp&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>, is an essay on Kirk Yetholm in
<i>Romano Lavo-Lil</i>.&nbsp; We would gladly have exchanged it
for an account of his visits to Abbotsford and Melrose, two
places which he saw in August of this year.</p>
<p>In his letter of 27th November from Kirkwall it will be seen
that Borrow records the kindness received from &ldquo;a young
gentleman of the name of Petrie.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is pleasant to
find that when he returned to England he did not forget that
kindness, as the next letter demonstrates:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Petrie</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span>, <span
class="smcap">Kirkwall</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">39 <span class="smcap">Camperdown

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Some weeks ago I
wrote to Mr. Murray [and] requested him to transmit to you two
works of mine.&nbsp; Should you not have received them by the
time this note reaches you, pray inform me and I will write to
him again.&nbsp; They may have come already, but whenever they
may come to hand, keep them in remembrance of one who will never
forget your kind attention to him in Orkney.</p>
<p>On reaching Aberdeen I went to Inverness by rail.&nbsp; From
there I sent off my luggage to Dunkeld, and walked thither by the
Highland road.&nbsp; I never enjoyed a walk more&mdash;the
weather was tolerably fine, and I was amidst some of the finest
scenery in the world.&nbsp; I was particularly struck with that
of Glen Truim.&nbsp; Near the top of the valley in sight of the
Craig of Badenoch on the left hand side of the way, I saw an
immense cairn, probably the memorial of some bloody clan
battle.&nbsp; On my journey I picked up from the mouth of an old
Highland woman a most remarkable tale concerning the death of
Fian or Fingal.&nbsp; <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>It differs entirely from the Irish
legends which I have heard on the subject&mdash;and is of a truly
mythic character.&nbsp; Since visiting Shetland I have thought a
great deal about the Picts, but cannot come to any satisfactory
conclusion.&nbsp; Were they Celts? were they Laps?&nbsp; Macbeth
could hardly have been a Lap, but then the tradition of the
country that they were a diminutive race, and their name was
Pight or Pict, which I almost think is the same as
petit&mdash;pixolo&mdash;puj&mdash;pigmy.&nbsp; It is a truly
perplexing subject&mdash;quite as much so as that of Fingal, and
whether he was a Scotsman or an Irishman I have never been able
to decide, as there has been so much to be said on both sides of
the question.&nbsp; Please present my kind remembrances to Mrs.
Petrie and all friends, particularly Mr. Sheriff Robertson, who
first did me the favour of making me acquainted with
you.&mdash;And believe me to remain, dear Sir, ever sincerely
yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
<p>Thank you for the newspaper&mdash;the notice was very kind,
but rather too flattering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same day that Borrow wrote, Mr. Petrie sent his
acknowledgment of the books, and so the letters crossed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was very agreeably surprised on opening a
packet, which came to me per steamer ten days ago, to find that
it contained a present from you of your highly interesting and
valuable works <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp;
Coming from any person such books would have been highly prized
by me, and it is therefore specially gratifying to have them
presented to me by their author.&nbsp; Please to accept of my
sincere and heartfelt thanks for your kind remembrance of me and
your valuable gift.&nbsp; May I request you to confer an
additional favour on me by sending me a slip of paper to be
pasted on each of the five volumes, stating that they were
presented to me by you.&nbsp; I would like to hand them down as
an heirloom to my family.&nbsp; I am afraid you will think that I
am a very troublesome acquaintance.</p>
<p>I would have written sooner, but I expected to have had some
information to give you about some of the existing superstitions
of Orkney which might perhaps have some interest for you.&nbsp; I
have, however, been much engrossed with county business during
the last fortnight, and must therefore reserve my account of
these matters till another opportunity.</p>
<p>Mr. Balfour, our principal landowner in Orkney, is just now
writing an article on the ancient laws and customs of the county
to be prefixed to a miscellaneous collection of documents,
chiefly of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; He is taking the
opportunity to give an account of the nature of the tenures by
which the ancient Jarls held the Jarldom, and the manner in which
the odalret became gradually supplanted.&nbsp; I have furnished
him with <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>several of the documents, and am just now going over it
with him.&nbsp; It is for the Bannatyne Club in Edinburgh that he
is preparing it, but I have suggested to him to have it printed
for general sale, as it is very interesting, and contains a great
mass of curious information condensed into a comparatively small
space.&nbsp; Mr. Balfour is very sorry that he had not the
pleasure of meeting you when you were here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My last glimpse of George Borrow in Scotland during his
memorable trip of the winter of 1858 is contained in a letter
that I received some time ago from the Rev. J. Wilcock of St.
Ringan&rsquo;s Manse, Lerwick, which runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>Nov.</i> 18th,
1903.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As I see that you
are interested in George Borrow, would you allow me to supply you
with a little notice of him which has not appeared in
print?&nbsp; A friend here&mdash;need I explain that this is
written from the capital of the Shetlands?&mdash;a friend, I say,
now dead, told me that one day early in the forenoon, during the
winter, he had walked out from the town for a stroll into the
country.&nbsp; About a mile out from the town is a piece of water
called the Loch of Clickimin, on a peninsula, in which is an
ancient (so-called) &ldquo;Pictish Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
attention was attracted by a tall, burly stranger, who was
surveying this ancient relic with deep interest.&nbsp; As the
water of the loch was well up about the castle, converting the
plot of ground on which it stood almost altogether into an
island, the stranger took off shoes and stockings and trousers,
and waded all round the building in order to get a thorough view
of it.&nbsp; This procedure was all the more remarkable from the
fact, as above mentioned, that the season was winter.&nbsp; I
believe that there was snow on the ground at the time.&nbsp; My
friend noticed on meeting him again in the course of the same
walk that he was very lightly clothed.&nbsp; He had on a cotton
shirt, a loose open jacket, and on the whole was evidently
indifferent to the rigour of our northern climate at that time of
the year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the visit to Belfast in 1866, Borrow was in
Ireland the year following his Scots tour of 1858, that is to say
from July to November, 1859.&nbsp; He went, accompanied by his
wife and daughter, by Holyhead to Dublin, where, as Dr. Knapp has
discovered, they resided at 75 St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green,
South.&nbsp; Borrow, as was his custom, left his family while he
was on a walking tour which included Connemara and on northward
to the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.&nbsp; He was keenly interested in
the two Societies in Dublin engaged upon the study of ancient
Irish literature, and he became <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>a member of the Ossianic Society in
July of this year.&nbsp; I have a number of Borrow&rsquo;s
translations from the Irish in my possession, but no notebooks of
his tour on this occasion.</p>
<p>All Irishmen who wish their country to preserve its
individuality should have a kindly feeling for George
Borrow.&nbsp; Opposed as he was to the majority of the people in
religion and in politics, he was about the only Englishman of his
time who took an interest in their national literature, language
and folk-lore.&nbsp; Had he written such another travel book
about Ireland as he wrote about Wales he would certainly have
added to the sum of human pleasure.</p>
<p>I find only one letter to his wife during this Irish
journey:</p>

passed through Leinster and Connaught.&nbsp; I have suffered a
good deal of hardship, for this is a very different country to
walk in from England.&nbsp; The food is bad and does not agree
with me.&nbsp; I shall be glad to get back, but first of all I
wish to walk to the Causeway.&nbsp; As soon as I have done that I
shall get on railroad and return, as I find there is a railroad
from Londonderry to Dublin.&nbsp; Pray direct to me at Post
Office, Londonderry.&nbsp; I have at present about seven pounds
remaining, perhaps it would bring me back to Dublin; however, to
prevent accidents, have the kindness to enclose me an order on
the Post Office, Londonderry, for five pounds.&nbsp; I expect to
be there next Monday, and to be home by the end of the
week.&nbsp; Glad enough I shall be to get back to you and
Hen.&nbsp; I got your letter at Galway.&nbsp; What you said about
poor Flora was comforting&mdash;pray take care of her.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t forget the order.&nbsp; I hope to write in a day or
two a kind of duplicate of this.&nbsp; I send Hen. heath from
Connemara, and also seaweed from a bay of the Atlantic.&nbsp; I
have walked across Ireland; the country people are civil; but I
believe all classes are disposed to join the French.&nbsp; The
idolatry and popery are beyond conception.&nbsp; God bless you,

222</span>CHAPTER XXIX<br />
<span class="smcap">&ldquo;the romany rye&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">George Borrow&rsquo;s</span> three most
important books had all a very interesting history.&nbsp; We have
seen the processes by which <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was built
up from note-books and letters.&nbsp; We have seen further the
most curious apprenticeship by which <i>Lavengro</i> came into
existence.&nbsp; The most distinctly English book&mdash;at least
in a certain absence of cosmopolitanism&mdash;that Victorian
literature produced was to a great extent written on scraps of
paper during a prolonged Continental tour which included
Constantinople and Budapest.&nbsp; In <i>Lavengro</i> we have
only half a book, the whole work, which included what came to be
published as <i>The Romany Rye</i>, having been intended to
appear in four volumes.&nbsp; The first volume was written in
1843, the second in 1845, after the Continental tour, which is
made use of in the description of the Hungarian, and the third
volume in the years between 1845 and 1848.&nbsp; Then in 1852
Borrow wrote out an &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; of a fourth
volume, which runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shortly will be published in one volume.&nbsp;
Price 10s.&nbsp; <i>The Rommany Rye</i>, Being the fourth volume
of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; By George Borrow, author of <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this volume did not make an appearance
&ldquo;shortly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its author was far too much offended
with the critics, too disheartened it may be to care to offer
himself again for their gibes.&nbsp; The years rolled on, much of
the time being spent at Yarmouth, a little of it at Oulton.&nbsp;
There was a visit to Cornwall in 1854, and another to Wales in
the same year.&nbsp; The Isle of Man was selected for a holiday
in 1855, and not until 1857 did <i>The Romany Rye</i>
appear.&nbsp; The book was now in two volumes, and we see that
the word Romany had dropped an &ldquo;m&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>The Romany Rye: A Sequel to
&ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; By George Borrow, author of
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Gypsies of
Spain,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;Fear God, and take your own
part.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Two Volumes.&nbsp; London: John Murray,
Albemarle Street, 1857.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are introduced once more to many old favourites, to
Petulengro, to the Man in Black, and above all to Isopel
Berners.&nbsp; The incidents of <i>Lavengro</i> are supposed to
have taken place between the 24th May, 1825, and the 18th July of
that year.&nbsp; In <i>The Romany Rye</i> the incidents
apparently occur between 19th July and 3rd August, 1825.&nbsp; In
the opinion of that most eminent of gypsy experts, Mr. John
Sampson, the whole of the episodes in the five volumes occurred
in seventy-two days.&nbsp; Mr. Sampson agrees with Dr. Knapp in
locating Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle in Momber or Monmer Lane,
Willenhall, Shropshire.&nbsp; The dingle has disappeared&mdash;it
is now occupied by the Monmer Lane Ironworks&mdash;but you may
still find Dingle Bridge and Dingle Lane.&nbsp; The book has
added to the glamour of gypsydom, and to the interest in the
gypsies which we all derive from <i>Lavengro</i>, but Mr. Sampson
makes short work of Borrow&rsquo;s gypsy learning on its
philological side.&nbsp; &ldquo;No gypsy,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;ever uses <i>chal</i> or <i>engro</i> as a separate word,
or talks of the <i>dukkering dook</i> or of <i>penning a
dukkerin</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Borrow&rsquo;s genders are
perversely incorrect&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Romany&rdquo;&mdash;a
word which can never get out of our language, let philologists
say what they will&mdash;should have been
&ldquo;Romani.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Haarstr&auml;ubend&rsquo; is the fitting
epithet,&rdquo; says Mr. Sampson, &ldquo;which an Oriental
scholar, Professor Richard Pischel of Berlin, finds to describe
Borrow&rsquo;s etymologies.&rdquo;&nbsp; But all this is very
unimportant, and the book remains in the whole of its forty-seven
chapters not one whit less a joy to us than does its predecessor
<i>Lavengro</i>, with its visions of gypsies and highwaymen and
boxers.</p>
<p>But then there is its &ldquo;Appendix.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
appendix of eleven petulant chapters undoubtedly did Borrow harm
in his day and generation.&nbsp; Now his fame is too great, and
his genius too firmly established for these strange dissertations
on men and things to offer anything but amusement or
edification.&nbsp; They reveal, for example, the singularly
non-literary character of this great man of letters.&nbsp;
Much&mdash;too much&mdash;has been made of his dislike of Walter
Scott and his writings.&nbsp; As a matter of fact Borrow tells us
that he <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>admired Scott both as a prose writer and as a
poet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since Scott he had read no modern
writer.&nbsp; Scott was greater than Homer,&rdquo; he told
Frances Cobbe.&nbsp; But he takes occasion to condemn his
&ldquo;Charlie o&rsquo;er the water nonsense,&rdquo; and declares
that his love of and sympathy with certain periods and incidents
have made for sympathy with what he always calls
&ldquo;Popery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, looking at the matter from an
entirely opposite point of view, Cardinal Newman declared that
the writings of Scott had had no inconsiderable influence in
directing his mind towards the Church of Rome.</p>
<blockquote><p>During the first quarter of this century a great
poet was raised up in the North, who, whatever were his defects,
has contributed by his works, in prose and verse, to prepare men
for some closer and more practical approximation to Catholic
truth.&nbsp; The general need of something deeper and more
attractive than what had offered itself elsewhere may be
considered to have led to his popularity; and by means of his
popularity he re-acted on his readers, stimulating their mental
thirst, feeding their hopes, setting before them visions, which,
when once seen, are not easily forgotten, and silently
indoctrinating them with nobler ideas, which might afterwards be
appealed to as first principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus we see that Borrow had a certain prescience in this
matter.&nbsp; But Borrow, in good truth, cared little for modern
English literature.&nbsp; His heart was entirely with the poets
of other lands&mdash;the Scandinavians and the Kelts.&nbsp; In
Virgil he apparently took little interest, nor in the great
poetry of Greece, Rome and England, although we find a reference
to Theocritus and Dante in his books.&nbsp; Fortunately for his
fame he had read <i>Gil Blas</i>, <i>Don Quixote</i>, and, above
all, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, which last book, first read as a boy
of six, coloured his whole life.&nbsp; Defoe and Fielding and
Bunyan were the English authors to whom he owed most.&nbsp; Of
Byron he has quaint things to say, and of Wordsworth things that
are neither quaint nor wise.&nbsp; We recall the man in the field
in the twenty-second chapter of <i>The Romany Rye</i> who used
Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry as a soporific.&nbsp; And throughout
his life Borrow&rsquo;s position towards his contemporaries in
literature was ever contemptuous.&nbsp; He makes no mention of
Carlyle or Ruskin or Matthew Arnold, and they in their turn, it
may be added, make no mention of him or of his works.&nbsp;
Thackeray he snubbed on one of the <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>few occasions they met, and Browning
and Tennyson were alike unrevealed to him.&nbsp; Borrow indeed
stands quite apart from the great literature of a period in which
he was a striking and individual figure.&nbsp; Lacking
appreciation in this sphere of work, he wrote of &ldquo;the
contemptible trade of author,&rdquo; counting it less creditable
than that of a jockey.</p>
<p>But all this is a digression from the progress of our
narrative of the advent of <i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; The book
was published in an edition of 1000 copies in April, 1857, and it
took thirty years to dispose of 3750 copies.&nbsp; Not more than
2000 copies of his book were sold in Great Britain during the
twenty-three remaining years of Borrow&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; What
wonder that he was embittered by his failure!&nbsp; The reviews
were far from favourable, although Mr. Elwin wrote not unkindly
in an article in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> called &ldquo;Roving
Life in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; No critic, however, was as severe
as <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, which had called <i>Lavengro</i>
&ldquo;balderdash&rdquo; and referred to <i>The Romany Rye</i> as
the &ldquo;literary dough&rdquo; of an author &ldquo;whose
dullest gypsy preparation we have now read.&rdquo;&nbsp; In later
years, when, alas! it was too late, <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>,
through the eloquent pen of Theodore Watts, made good
amends.&nbsp; But William Bodham Donne wrote to Borrow with
adequate enthusiasm:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">12 <span class="smcap">St.
James&rsquo;s Square</span>,<i> May</i> 24<i>th</i>, 1857.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I received your
book some days ago, but would not write to you before I was able
to read it, at least once, since it is needless, I hope, for me
to assure you that I am truly gratified by the gift.</p>
<p>Time to read it I could not find for some days after it was
sent hither, for what with winding up my affairs here, the
election of my successor, preparations for flitting, etc., etc.,
I have been incessantly occupied with matters needful to be done,
but far less agreeable to do than reading <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; All I have said of <i>Lavengro</i> to yourself
personally, or to others publicly or privately, I say again of
<i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; Everywhere in it the hand of the
master is stamped boldly and deeply.&nbsp; You join the chisel of
Dante with the pencil of Defoe.</p>
<p>I am rejoiced to see so many works announced of yours, for you
have more that is worth knowing to tell than any one I am
acquainted with.&nbsp; For your coming progeny&rsquo;s sake I am
disposed to wish you had worried the literary-craft less.&nbsp;
Brand and score them never so much, they will not turn and
repent, <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>but only spit the more froth and venom.&nbsp; I am
reckoning on my emancipation with an eagerness hardly proper at
my years, but I cannot help it, so thoroughly do I hate London,
and so much do I love the country.&nbsp; I have taken a house, or
rather a cottage, at Walton on Thames, just on the skirts of
Weybridge, and there I hope to see you before I come into
Norfolk, for I am afraid my face will not be turned eastward for
many weeks if not months.</p>
<p>Remember me kindly to Mrs. Borrow and Miss Clarke, and believe
me, my dear Sir, very truly and thankfully yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Wm. B.

</blockquote>
<p>And perhaps a letter from the then Town Clerk of Oxford is
worth reproducing here:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Town
Clerk&rsquo;s Office</span>, <span class="smcap">Oxford</span>,
19<i>th</i> <i>August</i> 1857.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;We have, attached to our
Corporation, an ancient jocular court composed of 13 of the poor
old freemen who attend the elections and have a king who sits
attired in scarlet with a crown and sentences interlopers
(non-freemen) to be cold-burned, <i>i.e.</i> a bucket or so of
water introduced to the offender&rsquo;s sleeve by means of the
city pump; but this infliction is of course generally commuted by
a small pecuniary compensation.</p>
<p>They call themselves &ldquo;Slaveonians&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Sclavonians.&rdquo;&nbsp; The only notice we have of them
in the city records is by the name of &ldquo;Slovens
Hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reading <i>Romany Rye</i> I notice your
account of the Sclaves and venture to trouble you with this, and
to enquire whether you think that the Sclaves might be connected
through the Saxons with the ancient municipal institutions of
this country.&nbsp; You are no doubt aware that Oxford is one of
the most ancient Saxon towns, being a royal bailiwick and
fortified before the Conquest,&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George P.

</blockquote>
<p>In spite of contemporary criticism, <i>The Romany Rye</i> is a
great book, or rather it contains the concluding chapters of a
great book.&nbsp; Sequels are usually proclaimed to be inferior
to their predecessors.&nbsp; But <i>The Romany Rye</i> is not a
sequel.&nbsp; It is part of <i>Lavengro</i>, and is therefore
Borrow&rsquo;s most imperishable monument.</p>

227</span>CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="smcap">Edward Fitzgerald</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Edward FitzGerald</span> once declared
that he was about the only friend with whom Borrow had never
quarrelled.&nbsp; There was probably no reason for this
exceptional amity other than the &ldquo;genius for
friendship&rdquo; with which FitzGerald has been rightly
credited.&nbsp; There were certainly, however, many points of
likeness between the two men which might have kept them at
peace.&nbsp; Both had written copiously and out of all proportion
to the public demand for their work.&nbsp; Both revelled in
translation.&nbsp; FitzGerald&rsquo;s eight volumes in a
magnificent American edition consist mainly of translations from
various tongues which no man presumably now reads.&nbsp; All the
world has read and will long continue to read his translation or
paraphrase of Omar Khayy&aacute;m&rsquo;s
<i>Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Fitz,&rdquo; as
his friends called him, lives by that, although his letters are
among the best in literature.&nbsp; Borrow wrote four books that
will live, but had publishers been amenable he would have
published forty, and all as unsaleable as the major part of
FitzGerald&rsquo;s translations.&nbsp; Both men were Suffolk
squires, and yet delighted more in the company of a class other
than their own, FitzGerald of boatmen, Borrow of gypsies; both
were counted eccentrics in their respective villages.&nbsp;
Perhaps alone among the great Victorian authors they lived to be
old without receiving in their lives any popular recognition of
their great literary achievements, if we except the momentary
recognition of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; But FitzGerald
had a more cultivated mind than Borrow.&nbsp; He loved literature
and literary men whilst Borrow did not.&nbsp; His criticism of
books is of the best, and his friendships with bookmen are among
the most interesting in literary history.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
solitary, shy, kind-hearted man,&rdquo; was the verdict upon him
of the frequently censorious Carlyle.&nbsp; When Anne Thackeray
asked her father which of his friends he had loved <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>best, he
answered &ldquo;Dear old Fitz, to be sure,&rdquo; and Tennyson
would have said the same.&nbsp; Borrow had none of these gifts as
a letter-writer and no genius for friendship.&nbsp; The charm of
his style, so indisputable in his best work, is absent from his
letters; and his friends were alienated one after another.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s undisciplined intellect and narrow upbringing were
a curse to him, from the point of view of his own personal
happiness, although they helped him to achieve exactly the work
for which he was best fitted.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s acquaintance
with FitzGerald was commenced by the latter, who, in July, 1853,
sent from Boulge Hall, Suffolk, to Oulton Hall, in the same
county, his recently published volume <i>Six Dramas of
Calderon</i>.&nbsp; He apologises for making so free with
&ldquo;a great man; but, as usual, I shall feel least fear before
a man like yourself who both do fine things in your own language
and are deep read in those of others.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also refers
to &ldquo;our common friend Donne,&rdquo; so that it is probable
that they had met at Donne&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The next letter,
also published by Dr. Knapp, that FitzGerald writes to Borrow is
dated from his home in Great Portland Street in 1856.&nbsp; He
presents his friend with a Turkish Dictionary, and announces his
coming marriage to Miss Barton, &ldquo;Our united ages amount to
96!&mdash;a dangerous experiment on both sides&rdquo;&mdash;as it
proved.&nbsp; The first reference to Borrow in the FitzGerald
<i>Letters</i> issued by his authorised publishers is addressed
to Professor Cowell in January, 1857:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was with Borrow a week ago at Donne&rsquo;s, and
also at Yarmouth three months ago: he is well, but not yet agreed
with Murray.&nbsp; He read me a long translation he had made from
the Turkish: which I could not admire, and his taste becomes
stranger than ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Borrow&rsquo;s genius if not his taste was always admired
by FitzGerald, as the following letter among my Borrow Papers
clearly indicates.&nbsp; Borrow had published <i>The Romany
Rye</i> at the beginning of May:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span>, <span
class="smcap">Oulton Hall</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Goldington
Hall</span>, <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>, <i>May</i>
24/57.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your Book was
put into my hands a week ago just as I was leaving London; so I
e&rsquo;en carried it down <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>here, and have been reading it under
the best Circumstances:&mdash;at such a Season&mdash;in the
Fields as they now are&mdash;and in company with a Friend I love
best in the world&mdash;who scarce ever reads a Book, but knows
better than I do what they are made of from a hint.</p>
<p>Well, lying in a Paddock of his, I have been travelling along
with you to Horncastle, etc.,&mdash;in a very delightful way for
the most part; something as I have travelled, and love to travel,
with Fielding, Cervantes, and Robinson Crusoe&mdash;and a smack
of all these there seems to me, with something beside, in your
book.&nbsp; But, as will happen in Travel, there were some spots
I didn&rsquo;t like so well&mdash;didn&rsquo;t like <i>at
all</i>: and sometimes wished to myself that I, a poor &ldquo;Man
of Taste,&rdquo; had been at your Elbow (who are a Man of much
more than Taste) to divert you, or get you by some means to pass
lightlier over some places.&nbsp; But you wouldn&rsquo;t have
heeded me, and won&rsquo;t heed me, and <i>must</i> go your own
way, I think&mdash;And in the parts I least like, I am yet
thankful for honest, daring, and original Thought and Speech such
as one hardly gets in these mealy-mouthed days.&nbsp; It was very
kind of you to send me your book.</p>
<p>My Wife is already established at a House called
&ldquo;Albert&rsquo;s Villa,&rdquo; or some such name, at
Gorlestone&mdash;but a short walk from you: and I am to find
myself there in a few days.&nbsp; So I shall perhaps tell you
more of my thoughts ere long.&nbsp; Now I shall finish this large
Sheet with a Tetrastich of one Omar Khayyam who was an Epicurean
Infidel some 500 years ago:</p>

<p style="text-align: right">and am yours very truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">Edward FitzGerald</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>In a
letter to Cowell about the same time&mdash;June 5,
1857&mdash;FitzGerald writes that he is about to set out for
Gorleston, Great Yarmouth:</p>
<blockquote><p>Within hail almost lives George Borrow, who has
lately published, and given me, two new volumes of Lavengro
called <i>Romany Rye</i>, with some excellent things, and some
very bad (as I have made bold to write to him&mdash;how shall I
face him!)&nbsp; You would not like the book at all I think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Cowell, it will be remembered, who introduced
FitzGerald to the Persian poet Omar, and afterwards regretted the
act.&nbsp; The first edition of <i>The Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of
Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i> appeared two years later, in 1859.&nbsp;
Edward Byles Cowell was born in Ipswich in 1826, and he was
educated at the Ipswich Grammar School.&nbsp; It was in the
library attached to the Ipswich Library Institution that Cowell
commenced the study of Oriental languages.&nbsp; In 1842 he
entered the business of his father and grandfather as a merchant
and maltster.&nbsp; When only twenty years of age he commenced
his friendship with Edward FitzGerald, and their correspondence
may be found in Dr. Aldis Wright&rsquo;s <i>FitzGerald
Correspondence</i>.&nbsp; In 1850 he left his brother to carry on
the business and entered himself at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where
he passed six years.&nbsp; At intervals he read Greek with
FitzGerald and, later, Persian.&nbsp; FitzGerald commenced to
learn this last language, which was to bring him fame, when he
was forty-four years of age.&nbsp; In 1856 Cowell was appointed
to a Professorship of English History at Calcutta, and from there
he sent FitzGerald a copy of the manuscript of <i>Omar
Khayy&aacute;m</i>, afterwards lent by FitzGerald to
Borrow.&nbsp; Much earlier than this&mdash;in
1853&mdash;FitzGerald had written to Borrow:</p>
<blockquote><p>At Ipswich, indeed, is a man whom you would like
to know, I think, and who would like to know you; one Edward
Cowell: a great scholar, if I may judge. . . .&nbsp; Should you
go to Ipswich do look for him! a great deal more worth looking
for (I speak with no sham modesty, I am sure) than
yours,&mdash;E. F. G.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty-six years afterwards&mdash;in 1879&mdash;we find
FitzGerald writing to Dr. Aldis Wright to the effect that Cowell
had been seized with &ldquo;a wish to learn Welsh under George
Borrow&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>And as he would not venture otherwise, I gave him
a Note of Introduction, and off he went, and had an hour with the
<a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>old Boy,
who was hard of hearing and shut up in a stuffy room, but cordial
enough; and Cowell was glad to have seen the Man, and tell him
that it was his <i>Wild Wales</i> which first inspired a thirst
for this language into the Professor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one short letter from FitzGerald to Borrow in Dr.
Aldis Wright&rsquo;s <i>FitzGerald Letters</i>.&nbsp; It is dated
June, 1857, and from it we learn that FitzGerald lent Borrow the
Calcutta manuscript of <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>, upon which he
based his own immortal translation, and from a letter to W. H.
Thompson in 1861 we learn that Cowell, who had inspired the
writing of FitzGerald&rsquo;s <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>, Donne
and Borrow were the only three friends to whom he had sent copies
of his &ldquo;peccadilloes in verse&rdquo; as he calls his
remarkable translation, and this two years after it was
published.&nbsp; A letter, dated July 6, 1857, asks for the
return of FitzGerald&rsquo;s copy of the Ouseley manuscript of
<i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>, Borrow having clearly already
returned the Calcutta manuscript.&nbsp; This letter concludes on
a pathetic note:</p>
<blockquote><p>My old Parson Crabbe is bowing down under
epileptic fits, or something like, and I believe his brave old
white head will soon sink into the village church sward.&nbsp;
Why, <i>our</i> time seems coming.&nbsp; Make way, gentlemen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow comes more than once into the story of
FitzGerald&rsquo;s great translation of <i>Omar
Khayy&aacute;m</i>, which in our day has caused so great a
sensation, and deserves all the enthusiasm that it has excited as
the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . golden Eastern lay,<br />
Than which I know no version done<br />
In English more divinely well,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to quote Tennyson&rsquo;s famous eulogy.&nbsp; Cowell, to his
after regret, for he had none of FitzGerald&rsquo;s <i>dolce far
niente</i> paganism, had sent FitzGerald from Calcutta, where he
was, the manuscript of Omar Khayyam&rsquo;s
<i>Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i> in Persian, and FitzGerald was
captured by it.&nbsp; Two years later, as we know, he produced
the translation, which was so much more than a translation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Omar breathes a sort of consolation to me,&rdquo; he wrote
to Cowell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Borrow is greatly delighted with your MS.
of Omar which I showed <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>him,&rdquo; he says in another
letter to Cowell (23rd June, 1857), &ldquo;delighted at the
terseness so unusual in Oriental verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next two letters by FitzGerald from my Borrow Papers are
of the year 1859, the year of the first publication of the
<i>Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">10 <span class="smcap">Marine

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;I have come
here with three nieces to give them sea air and change.&nbsp;
They are all perfectly quiet, sensible, and unpretentious girls;
so as, if you will come over here any day or days, we will find
you board and bed too, for a week longer at any rate.&nbsp; There
is a good room below, which we now only use for meals, but which
you and I can be quite at our sole ease in.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you
come?</p>
<p>I purpose (and indeed have been some while intentioning) to go
over to Yarmouth to look for you.&nbsp; But I write this note in
hope it may bring you hither also.</p>
<p>Donne has got his soldier boy home from
India&mdash;Freddy&mdash;I always thought him a very nice fellow
indeed.&nbsp; No doubt life is happy enough to all of them just
now.&nbsp; Donne has been on a visit to the Highlands&mdash;which
seems to have pleased him&mdash;I have got an MS. of Bahram and
his Seven Castles (Persian), which I have not yet cared to look
far into.&nbsp; Will you?&nbsp; It is short, fairly transcribed,
and of some repute in its own country, I hear.&nbsp; Cowell sent
it me from Calcutta; but it almost requires <i>his</i> company to
make one devote one&rsquo;s time to Persian, when, with what
remains of one&rsquo;s old English eyes, one can read the Odyssey
and Shakespeare.</p>
<p>With compliments to the ladies, believe me, Yours very
truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Edward

to Yarmouth but I don&rsquo;t know if you and yours be there at
all, nor if there, whereabout.&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t hear at all

after losing my greatest friend, the Bedfordshire lad who was

<p>In a letter to George Crabbe the third, and the grandson of
the poet, in 1862, FitzGerald tells him that he has just been
reading Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Wild Wales</i>, &ldquo;which <i>I</i>
like well because I can hear him talking it.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t know if others will like it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No
one writes better English than Borrow in general,&rdquo; he
says.&nbsp; But FitzGerald, as a lover of style, is vexed with
some of Borrow&rsquo;s phrases, and instances one:
&ldquo;&lsquo;The scenery was beautiful <i>to a
degree</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>What</i> degree?&nbsp; When did this
vile phrase arise?&rdquo;&nbsp; The criticism is just, but
Borrow, in common with many other great English authors whose
work will live, was not uniformly a good stylist.&nbsp; He has
many lamentable fallings away from the ideals of the
stylist.&nbsp; But he will, by virtue of a wonderful
individuality, outlive many a good stylist.&nbsp; His four great
books are immortal, and one of them is <i>Wild Wales</i>.</p>
<p>We have a glimpse of FitzGerald in the following letter in my
possession, by the friend who had introduced him to Borrow,
William Bodham Donne:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">40 <span class="smcap">Weymouth
Street</span>, <span class="smcap">Portland Place</span>, <span
class="smcap">W.</span>,<br />
<i>November</i> 28/62.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;Many thanks
for the copy of <i>Wild Wales</i> reserved for and sent to me by
Mr. R. Cooke.&nbsp; Before this copy arrived I had obtained one
from the London Library and read it through, not exactly <i>stans
pede in uno</i>, but certainly almost at a stretch.&nbsp; I could
not indeed lay it down, it interested me so much.&nbsp; It is one
of the very best records of home travel, if indeed so strange a
country as Wales is can properly be called <i>home</i>, I have
ever met with.</p>
<p>Immediately on closing the third volume I secured a few pages
in <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for <i>Wild Wales</i>, for
though you do not stand in need of my aid, yet my notice will not
do you a mischief, and some of the reviewers of <i>Lavengro</i>
were, I recollect, shocking blockheads, misinterpreting the
letter and <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>misconceiving the spirit of that work.&nbsp; I have,
since we met in Burlington Arcade, been on a visit to
FitzGerald.&nbsp; He is in better spirits by far than when I saw
him about the same time in last year.&nbsp; He has his pictures
and his chattels about him, and has picked up some acquaintance
among the merchants and mariners of Woodbridge, who, although far
below his level, are yet better company than the two old skippers
he was consorting with in 1861.&nbsp; They&mdash;his present
friends&mdash;came in of an evening, and sat and drank and
talked, and I enjoyed their talk very much, since they discussed
of what they understood, which is more than I can say generally
of the fine folks I occasionally (very occasionally now) meet in
London.&nbsp; I should have said more about your book, only I
wish to keep it for print: and you don&rsquo;t need to be told by
me that it is very good.&mdash;With best regards to Mrs. Borrow
and Miss Clarke, I am, yours ever truly,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The last letter from FitzGerald to Borrow is dated many years
after the correspondence I have here printed.&nbsp; From it we
gather that there had been no correspondence in the
interval.&nbsp; FitzGerald writes from Little Grange, Woodbridge,
in January, 1875, to say that he had received a message from
Borrow that he would be glad to see him at Oulton.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
think the more of it,&rdquo; says FitzGerald, &ldquo;because I
imagine, from what I have heard, that you have slunk away from
human company as much as I have.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hints that they
might not like one another so well after a fifteen years&rsquo;
separation.&nbsp; He declares with infinite pathos that he has
now severed himself from all old ties, has refused the
invitations of old college friends and old school-fellows.&nbsp;
To him there was no companionship possible for his declining days
other than his reflections and verses.&nbsp; It is a fine letter,
filled with that graciousness of spirit that was ever a trait in
FitzGerald&rsquo;s noble nature.&nbsp; The two men never met
again.&nbsp; Borrow died in 1881, FitzGerald two years later.</p>

235</span>CHAPTER XXXI<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Wild Wales</span>&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1854 was an adventurous
one in Borrow&rsquo;s life, for he, so essentially a Celt, had in
that year two interesting experiences of the &ldquo;Celtic
Fringe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spent the first months of the year in
Cornwall, as we have seen, and from July to November he was in
Wales.&nbsp; That tour he recorded in pencilled note-books, four
of which are in the Knapp Collection in New York, and are duly
referred to in Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s biography, and two of which are
in my possession.&nbsp; In addition to this I have the complete
manuscript of <i>Wild Wales</i> in Borrow&rsquo;s handwriting,
and many variants of it in countless, carefully written
pages.&nbsp; Therein lie the possibilities of a singularly
interesting edition of <i>Wild Wales</i> should opportunity offer
for its publication.&nbsp; When I examine the manuscript, with
its demonstration of careful preparation, I do not wonder that it
took Borrow eight years&mdash;from 1854 to 1862&mdash;to prepare
this book for the press.&nbsp; Assuredly we recognise here, as in
all his books, that he realised Carlyle&rsquo;s definition of
genius&mdash;&ldquo;the transcendent capacity of taking
trouble&mdash;first of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on 27th July, 1854, that Borrow, his wife and her
daughter, Henrietta Clarke, set out on their journey to North
Wales.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp prints two kindly letters from Mrs. Borrow
to her mother-in-law written from Llangollen on this tour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are in a lovely quiet spot,&rdquo; she writes,
&ldquo;Dear George goes out exploring the mountains. . . .&nbsp;
The poor here are humble, simple, and good.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
second letter Mrs. Borrow records that her husband &ldquo;keeps a
<i>daily</i> journal of all that goes on, so that he can make a
most amusing book in a month.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet Borrow took eight
years to make it.&nbsp; The failure of <i>The Romany Rye</i>,
which was due for publication before <i>Wild Wales</i>, accounts
for this, and perhaps also the disappointment that another book,
long since ready, did not find a publisher.&nbsp; In the <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>letter from
which I have quoted Mary Borrow tells Anne Borrow that her son
will, she expects at Christmas, publish <i>The Romany Rye</i>,
&ldquo;together with his poetry in all the European
languages.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last book had been on his hands for
many a day, and indeed in <i>Wild Wales</i> he writes of &ldquo;a
mountain of unpublished translations&rdquo; of which this book,
duly advertised in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, was a part.</p>
<p>After an ascent of Snowdon arm in arm with Henrietta, Mrs.
Borrow remaining behind, Borrow left his wife and daughter to
find their way back to Yarmouth, and continued his journey, all
of which is most picturesquely described in <i>Wild
Wales</i>.&nbsp; Before that book was published, however, Borrow
was to visit the Isle of Man, Scotland, and Ireland.&nbsp; He was
to publish <i>The Romany Rye</i> (1857); to see his mother die
(1858); and to issue his very limited edition of <i>The Sleeping
Bard</i> (1860); and, lastly, to remove to Brompton (1860).&nbsp;
It was at the end of the year 1862 that <i>Wild Wales</i> was
published.&nbsp; It had been written during the two years
immediately following the tour in Wales, in 1855 and 1856.&nbsp;
It had been announced as ready for publication in 1857, but
doubtless the chilly reception of <i>The Romany Rye</i> in that
year, of which we have written, had made Borrow lukewarm as to
venturing once more before the public.&nbsp; The public was again
irresponsive.&nbsp; <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i>, then edited by
Thackeray, declared the book to be &ldquo;tiresome
reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>Spectator</i> reviewer was more
kindly, but nowhere was there any enthusiasm.&nbsp; Only a
thousand copies were sold, and a second edition did not appear
until 1865, and not another until seven years after
Borrow&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Yet the author had the encouragement
that comes from kindly correspondents.&nbsp; Here, for example,
is a letter that could not but have pleased him:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">West
Hill Lodge</span>, <span class="smcap">Highgate</span>,<br />
<i>Dec.</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1862.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;We have had a great
Christmas pleasure this year&mdash;the reading of your <i>Wild
Wales</i>, which has taken us so deliciously into the lovely
fresh scenery and life of that pleasant mountain-land.&nbsp; My
husband and myself made a little walking tour over some of your
ground in North Wales this year; my daughter and her uncle,
Richard Howitt, did the same; and we have been ourselves
collecting material for a work, the scenes of which will be laid
amidst some of our and your favourite mountains.&nbsp; <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>But the
object of my writing was not to tell you this; but after assuring
you of the pleasure your work has given us&mdash;to say also that
in one respect it has tantalised us.&nbsp; You have told over and
over again to fascinated audiences, Lope de Vega&rsquo;s ghost
story, but still leave the poor reader at the end of the book
longing to hear it in vain.</p>
<p>May I ask you, therefore, to inform us in which of Lope de
Vega&rsquo;s numerous works this same ghost story is to be
found?&nbsp; We like ghost stories, and to a certain extent
believe in them, we deserve therefore to know the best ghost
story in the world.</p>
<p>Wishing for you, your wife and your Henrietta, all the
compliments of the season in the best and truest sense of
expression.&mdash;I am, dear sir, yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Mary
Howitt</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference to Lope de Vega&rsquo;s ghost story is due to
the fact that in the fifty-fifth chapter of <i>Wild Wales</i>,
Borrow, after declaring that Lope de Vega was &ldquo;one of the
greatest geniuses that ever lived,&rdquo; added, that among his
tales may be found &ldquo;the best ghost story in the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Knapp found the story in Borrow&rsquo;s
handwriting among the manuscripts that came to him, and gives it
in full.&nbsp; In good truth it is but moderately interesting,
although Borrow seems to have told it to many audiences when in
Wales, but this perhaps provides the humour of the
situation.&nbsp; It seems clear that Borrow contemplated
publishing Lope de Vega&rsquo;s ghost story in a later
book.&nbsp; We note here, indeed, a letter of a much later date
in which Borrow refers to the possibility of a supplement to
<i>Wild Wales</i>, the only suggestion of such a book that I have
seen, although there is plenty of new manuscript in my Borrow
collection to have made such a book possible had Borrow been
encouraged by his publisher and the public to write it.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
J. Evan Williams</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">22 <span class="smcap">Hereford
Square</span>, <span class="smcap">Brompton</span>, <i>Decr.</i>
31, 1863.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received
your letter and thank you for the kind manner in which you are
pleased to express yourself concerning me.&nbsp; Now for your
questions.&nbsp; With respect to Lope De Vega&rsquo;s ghost
story, I beg to say that I am thinking of publishing a supplement
to my <i>Wild Wales</i> in which, amongst other things, I shall
give a full account of the tale and point out where it is to be
found.&nbsp; You cannot imagine the number of letters I receive
on the subject of that ghost story.&nbsp; With regard to the
Sclavonian languages, I wish to observe that they are all well
deserving of study.&nbsp; The Servian and Bohemian contain a
great many old <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>traditionary songs, and the latter possesses a curious
though not very extensive prose literature.&nbsp; The Polish has,
I may say, been rendered immortal by the writings of Mickiewicz,
whose &lsquo;Conrad Wallenrod&rsquo; is probably the most
remarkable poem of the present century.&nbsp; The Russian,
however, is the most important of all the Sclavonian tongues, not
on account of its literature but because it is spoken by fifty
millions of people, it being the dominant speech from the Gulf of
Finland to the frontiers of China.&nbsp; There is a remarkable
similarity both in sound and sense between many Russian and Welsh
words, for example &ldquo;tchel&oacute;&rdquo; is the Russian for
forehead, &ldquo;tal&rdquo; is Welsh for the same;
&ldquo;iasn&uuml;y&rdquo; (neuter &ldquo;iasnoe&rdquo;) is the
Russian for clear or radiant, &ldquo;iesin&rdquo; the Welsh, so
that if it were grammatical in Russian to place the adjective
after the noun as is the custom in Welsh, the Welsh compound
&ldquo;Taliesin&rdquo; (Radiant forehead) might be rendered in
Russian by &ldquo;Tchel&#333;iasnoe,&rdquo; which would be
wondrously like the Welsh name; unfortunately, however, Russian
grammar would compel any one wishing to Russianise
&ldquo;Taliesin&rdquo; to say not &ldquo;Tchel&#333;iasnoe&rdquo;
but &ldquo;Iasnoetchel&#333;.&rdquo;&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another letter that Borrow owed to his <i>Wild Wales</i> may
well have place here.&nbsp; It will be recalled that in his
fortieth chapter he waxes enthusiastic over Lewis Morris, the
Welsh bard, who was born in Anglesey in 1700 and died in
1765.&nbsp; Morris&rsquo;s great-grandson, Sir Lewis Morris
(1833&ndash;1907), the author of the once popular <i>Epic of
Hades</i>, was twenty-nine years of age when he wrote to Borrow
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Reform
Club</span>.&nbsp; <i>Dec.</i> 29, 1862.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just finished
reading your work on <i>Wild Wales</i>, and cannot refrain from
writing to thank you for the very lifelike picture of the Welsh
people, North and South, which, unlike other Englishmen, you have
managed to give us.&nbsp; To ordinary Englishmen the language is
of course an insurmountable bar to any real knowledge of the
people, and the result is that within six hours of Paddington or
Euston Square is a country nibbled at superficially by droves of
holiday-makers, but not really better known than Asia
Minor.&nbsp; I wish it were possible to get rid of all obstacles
which stand in the way of the development of the Welsh people and
the Welsh intellect.&nbsp; In the meantime every book which like
yours tends to lighten the thick darkness which seems to hang
round Wales deserves the acknowledgments of every true
Welshman.&nbsp; I am, perhaps, more especially called upon to
express my thanks for the very high terms in which you speak of
my great-grandfather, Lewis Morris.&nbsp; I believe you <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>have not
said a word more than he deserves.&nbsp; Some of the facts which
you mention with regard to him were unknown to me, and as I take
a very great interest in everything relating to my ancestor I
venture to ask you whether you can indicate any source of
knowledge with regard to him and his wife, other than those which
I have at present&mdash;viz., an old number of the <i>Cambrian
Register</i> and some notices of him in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, 1760&ndash;70.&nbsp; There is also a letter of his
in Lord Teignmouth&rsquo;s <i>Life of Sir William Jones</i> in
which he claims kindred with that great scholar.&nbsp; Many of
his manuscript poems and much correspondence are now in the
library of the British Museum, most of them I regret to say a
sealed book to one who like myself had yet to learn Welsh.&nbsp;
But I am not the less anxious to learn all that can be
ascertained about my great ancestor.&nbsp; I should say that two
of his brothers, Richard and William, were eminent Welsh
scholars.</p>
<p>With apologies for addressing you so unceremoniously, and with
renewed thanks, I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Lewis
Morris</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting letter to Borrow from another once popular
writer belongs to this period:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
George Borrow</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">The
&ldquo;Press&rdquo; Office</span>, <span
class="smcap">Strand</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Westminster</span>, <i>Thursday</i>.</p>
<p>One who has read and delighted in everything Mr. Borrow has
yet published ventures to say how great has been his delight in
reading <i>Wild Wales</i>.&nbsp; No philologist or linguist, I am
yet an untiring walker and versifier: and really I think that few
things are pleasanter than to walk and to versify.&nbsp; Also,
well do I love good ale, natural drink of the English.&nbsp; If I
could envy anything, it is your linguistic faculty, which unlocks
to you the hearts of the unknown races of these
islands&mdash;unknown, I mean, as to their real feelings and
habits, to ordinary Englishmen&mdash;and your still higher
faculty of describing your adventures in the purest and raciest
English of the day.&nbsp; I send you a Danish daily journal,
which you may not have seen.&nbsp; Once a week it issues articles
in English.&nbsp; How beautiful (but of course not new to you) is
the legend of Queen Dagmar, given in this number!&nbsp; A noble
race, the Danes: glad am I to see their blood about to refresh
that which runs in the royal veins of England.&nbsp; Sorry and
ashamed to see a Russell bullying and insulting them.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Mortimer
Collins</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How greatly Borrow was disappointed at the comparative failure
of <i>Wild Wales</i> may be gathered from a <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>curt
message to his publisher which I find among his papers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Borrow has been applied to by a country
bookseller, who is desirous of knowing why there is not another
edition of <i>Wild Wales</i>, as he cannot procure a copy of the
book, for which he receives frequent orders.&nbsp; That it was
not published in a cheap form as soon as the edition of 1862 was
exhausted has caused much surprise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow, it will be remembered, left Wales at Chepstow, as
recorded in the hundred and ninth and final chapter of <i>Wild
Wales</i>, &ldquo;where I purchased a first class ticket, and
ensconcing myself in a comfortable carriage, was soon on my way
to London, where I arrived at about four o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the following letter to his wife there
is a slight discrepancy, of no importance, as to time:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. George Borrow</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">53a Pall
Mall</span>, <span class="smcap">London</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Wife Carreta</span>,&mdash;I arrived
here about five o&rsquo;clock this morning&mdash;time I saw
you.&nbsp; I have walked about 250 miles.&nbsp; I walked the
whole way from the North to the South&mdash;then turning to the
East traversed Glamorganshire and the county of Monmouth, and
came out at Chepstow.&nbsp; My boots were worn up by the time I
reached Swansea, and was obliged to get them new soled and
welted.&nbsp; I have seen wonderful mountains, waterfalls, and
people.&nbsp; On the other side of the Black Mountains I met a
cartload of gypsies; they were in a dreadful rage and were
abusing the country right and left.&nbsp; My last ninety miles
proved not very comfortable, there was so much rain.&nbsp; Pray
let me have some money by Monday as I am nearly without any, as
you may well suppose, for I was three weeks on my journey.&nbsp;
I left you on a Thursday, and reached Chepstow yesterday,
Thursday, evening.&nbsp; I hope you, my mother, and Hen. are
well.&nbsp; I have seen Murray and Cooke.&mdash;God bless you,
yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George
Borrow</span>.</p>
<p>(Keep this.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before Borrow put the finishing touches to <i>Wild Wales</i>
he repeated his visit of 1854.&nbsp; This was in 1857, the year
of <i>The Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp records the fact
through a letter to Mr. John Murray from Shrewsbury, in which he
discusses the possibility of a second edition of <i>The Romany
Rye</i>: &ldquo;I have lately been taking a walk in Wales of
upwards <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>of five hundred miles,&rdquo; he writes.&nbsp; This
tour lasted from August 23rd to October 5th.&nbsp; I find four
letters to his wife that were written in this holiday.&nbsp; He
does not seem to have made any use of this second tour in his
<i>Wild Wales</i>, although I have abundance of manuscript notes
upon it in my possession.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To

hot and affected my head and likewise my sight slightly; moreover
one of the shoes hurt my foot.&nbsp; I came to this place to-day
and shall presently leave it for Pembroke on my way back, I shall
write to you from there.&nbsp; I shall return by Cardigan.&nbsp;
What I want you to do is to write to me directed to the post
office, Cardigan (in Cardiganshire), and either inclose a post
office order for five pounds or an order from Lloyd and Co. on
the banker of that place for the same sum; but at any rate write
or I shall not know what to do.&nbsp; I would return by railroad,
but in that event I must go to London, for there are no railroads
from here to Shrewsbury.&nbsp; I wish moreover to see a little
more.&nbsp; Just speak to the banker and don&rsquo;t lose any
time.&nbsp; Send letter, and either order in it, or say that I
can get it at the bankers.&nbsp; I hope all is well.&nbsp; God

<p>In <i>Wild Wales</i> we have George Borrow in his most genial
mood.&nbsp; There are none of the hair-breadth escapes and grim
experiences of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, none of the romance and
the glamour of <i>Lavengro</i> and its sequel, but there is good
humour, a humour that does not obtain in the three more important
works, and there is an amazing amount of frank candour of a
biographical kind.&nbsp; We even have a reference to Isopel
Berners, referred to by Captain Bosvile as &ldquo;the young woman
you used to keep company with . . . a fine young woman and a
virtuous.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the happiest of Borrow&rsquo;s
books, and not unnaturally.&nbsp; He was having a genuine
holiday, and he had the companionship during a part of it of his
wife and daughter, of whom he was, as this book is partly written
to prove, very genuinely fond.&nbsp; He also enjoyed the
singularly felicitous experience of harking back upon some of his
earliest memories.&nbsp; He was able to retrace the steps he took
in the Welsh language during his boyhood:</p>
<blockquote><p>That night I sat up very late reading the life of
Twm O&rsquo;r Nant, written by himself in choice Welsh. . .
.&nbsp; The life I had read in my boyhood in an old Welsh
magazine, and I now read it again with great zest, and no wonder,
as it is probably the most remarkable autobiography ever
penned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in this ecstatic mood that he passes through
Wales.&nbsp; Let me recall the eulogy on &ldquo;Gronwy&rdquo;
Owen, and here <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>it may be said that Borrow rarely got his spelling
correct of the proper names of his various literary heroes, in
the various Norse and Celtic tongues in which he delighted.&nbsp;
But how much Borrow delighted in his poets may be seen by his
eulogy on Goronwy Owen, which in its pathos recalls
Carlyle&rsquo;s similar eulogies over poor German scholars who
interested him, Jean Paul Richter and Heyne, for example.&nbsp;
Borrow ignored Owen&rsquo;s persistent intemperance and general
impracticability.&nbsp; Here and here only, indeed, does he
remind one of Carlyle.&nbsp; He had a great capacity for
hero-worship, although the two were not interested in the same
heroes.&nbsp; His hero-worship of Owen took him over large tracks
of country in search of that poet&rsquo;s birthplace.&nbsp; He
writes of the delight he takes in inspecting the birth-places and
haunts of poets.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is because I am fond of poetry,
poets, and their haunts, that I am come to Anglesey.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I proceeded on my way,&rdquo; he says elsewhere, &ldquo;in
high spirits indeed, having now seen not only the tomb of the
Tudors, but one of those sober poets for which Anglesey has
always been so famous.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus it is that <i>Wild
Wales</i> is a high-spirited book, which will always be a delight
and a joy not only to Welshmen, who, it may be hoped, have by
this time forgiven &ldquo;the ecclesiastical cat&rdquo; of
Llangollen, but to all who rejoice in the great classics of the
English tongue.</p>

<span class="smcap">Life In London</span>, 1860&ndash;1874</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">George Borrow&rsquo;s</span> earlier
visits to London are duly recorded, with that glamour of which he
was a master, in the pages of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; Who can
cross London Bridge even to-day without thinking of the
apple-woman and her copy of <i>Moll Flanders</i>; and many
passages of Borrow&rsquo;s great book make a very special appeal
to the lover of London.&nbsp; Then there was that visit to the
Bible Society&rsquo;s office made on foot from Norwich, and the
expedition a few months later to pass an examination in the
Manchu language.&nbsp; When he became a country squire and the
author of the very successful <i>Bible in Spain</i> Borrow
frequently visited London, and his various residences may be
traced from his letters.&nbsp; Take, for example, these five
notes to his wife, the first apparently written in 1848, but all
undated:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Tuesday afternoon</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Wife</span>,&mdash;I just write
you a line to tell you that I am tolerably well as I hope you
are.&nbsp; Every thing is in confusion abroad.&nbsp; The French
King has disappeared and will probably never be heard of, though
they are expecting him in England.&nbsp; Funds are down nearly to
eighty.&nbsp; The Government have given up the income tax and
people are very glad of it.&nbsp; <i>I am not</i>.&nbsp; With
respect to the funds, if I were to sell out I should not know
what to do with the money.&nbsp; J. says they will rise.&nbsp; I
do not think they will, they may, however, fluctuate a
little.&mdash;Keep up your spirits, my heart&rsquo;s dearest, and
kiss old Hen. for me.</p>

<p>Borrow was in London in 1845 and again in 1848.&nbsp; There
must have been other occasional visits on the way to this or that
starting point of his annual holiday, but in 1860 Borrow took a
house in London, and he resided there until 1874, when he
returned to Oulton.&nbsp; In a letter to Mr. John Murray, written
from Ireland in November, 1859, Mrs. Borrow writes to the effect
that in the spring of the following year she will wish to look
round &ldquo;and select a pleasant holiday residence within three
to ten miles of London.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no doubt that a
succession of winters on Oulton Broad had been very detrimental
to Mrs. Borrow&rsquo;s health, although they had no effect on
Borrow, who bathed there with equal indifference in winter as in
summer, having, as he tells us in <i>Wild Wales</i>,
&ldquo;always had the health of an elephant.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so
Borrow and his wife arrived in London in June, and took temporary
lodgings at 21 Montagu Street, Portman Square.&nbsp; In September
they went into occupation of a house in Brompton&mdash;22
Hereford Square, which is now commemorated by a County Council
tablet.&nbsp; Here Borrow <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>resided for fourteen years, and here
his wife died on 30th January, 1869.&nbsp; She was buried in
Brompton Cemetery, where Borrow was laid beside her twelve years
later.&nbsp; For neighbours on the one side the Borrows had Mr.
Robert Collinson and, on the other, Miss Frances Power Cobbe and
her companion, Miss M. C. Lloyd.&nbsp; From Miss Cobbe we have
occasional glimpses of Borrow, all of them unkindly.&nbsp; She
was of Irish extraction, her father having been grandson of
Charles Cobbe, Archbishop of Dublin.&nbsp; Miss Cobbe was an
active woman in all kinds of journalistic and philanthropic
enterprises in the London of the &rsquo;seventies and
&rsquo;eighties of the last century, writing in particular in the
now defunct newspaper, the <i>Echo</i>, and she wrote dozens of
books and pamphlets, all of them forgotten except her
<i>Autobiography</i>, in which she devoted several pages to her
neighbour in Hereford Square.&nbsp; Borrow had no sympathy with
fanatical women with many &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; and the pair did
not agree, although many neighbourly courtesies passed between
them for a time.&nbsp; Here is an extract from Miss Cobbe&rsquo;s
<i>Autobiography</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>George Borrow, who, if he were not a gypsy by
blood, <i>ought</i> to have been one, was for some years our near
neighbour in Hereford Square.&nbsp; My friend was amused by his
quaint stories and his (real or sham) enthusiasm for Wales, and
cultivated his acquaintance.&nbsp; I never liked him, thinking
him more or less of a hypocrite.&nbsp; His missions, recorded in
<i>The Bible in Spain</i>, and his translations of the Scriptures
into the out-of-the-way tongues, for which he had a gift, were by
no means consonant with his real opinions concerning the veracity
of the said Bible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One only needs to quote this by the light of the story as told
so far in these pages to see how entirely Miss Cobbe
misunderstood Borrow, or rather how little insight she was able
to bring to a study of his curious character.&nbsp; The rest of
her attempt at interpretation is largely taken up to demonstrate
how much more clever and more learned she was than Borrow.&nbsp;
Altogether it is a sorry spectacle, this of the
pseudo-philanthropist relating her conversations with a man
broken by misfortune and the death of his wife.&nbsp; Many of
Miss Cobbe&rsquo;s statements have passed into current
acceptance.&nbsp; I do not find them convincing.&nbsp; Archdeacon
Whately on the other hand tells us that he always found <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Borrow
&ldquo;most civil and hospitable,&rdquo; and his sister gives us
the following &ldquo;impression&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Mr. Borrow returned from this Spanish
journey, which had been full, as we all know, of most
entertaining adventures, related with much liveliness and spirit
by himself, he was regarded as a kind of &ldquo;lion&rdquo; in
the literary circles of London.&nbsp; When we first saw him it
was at the house of a lady who took great pleasure in gathering
&ldquo;celebrities&rdquo; in various ways around her, and our
party was struck with the appearance of this renowned
traveller&mdash;a tall, thin, spare man with prematurely white
hair and intensely dark eyes, as he stood upright against the
wall of one of the drawing-rooms and received the homage of
lion-hunting guests, and listened in silence to their
unsuccessful attempts to make him talk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this sojourn in London, which was undertaken because
Oulton and Yarmouth did not agree with his wife, Borrow suffered
the tragedy of her loss.&nbsp; Borrow dragged on his existence in
London for another five years, a much broken man.&nbsp; It is
extraordinary how little we know of Borrow during that fourteen
years&rsquo; sojourn in London; how rarely we meet him in the
literary memoirs of this period.&nbsp; Happily one or two
pleasant friendships relieved the sadness of his days; and in
particular the reminiscences of Walter Theodore Watts-Dunton
assist us to a more correct appreciation of the Borrow of these
last years of London life.&nbsp; Of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;memories,&rdquo; we shall write in our next chapter.&nbsp;
Here it remains only to note that Borrow still continued to
interest himself in his various efforts at translation, and in
1861 and 1862 the editor of <i>Once a Week</i> printed various
ballads and stories from his pen.&nbsp; The volumes of this
periodical are before me, and I find illustrations by Sir John
Millais, Sir E. J. Poynter, Simeon Solomon and George Du Maurier;
stories by Mrs. Henry Wood and Harriet Martineau, and articles by
Walter Thornbury.</p>
<p>In 1862 <i>Wild Wales</i> was published, as we have
seen.&nbsp; In 1865 Henrietta married William MacOubrey, and in
the following year, Borrow and his wife went to visit the pair in
their Belfast home.&nbsp; In the beginning of the year 1869 Mrs.
Borrow died, aged seventy-three.&nbsp; There are no records of
the tragedy that are worth perpetuating.&nbsp; Borrow consumed
his own smoke.&nbsp; With his wife&rsquo;s death his life was <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>indeed a
wreck.&nbsp; No wonder he was so &ldquo;rude&rdquo; to that least
perceptive of women, Miss Cobbe.&nbsp; Some four or five years
more Borrow lingered on in London, cheered at times by walks and
talks with Gordon Hake and Watts-Dunton, and he then returned to
Oulton&mdash;a most friendless man.</p>

250</span>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />
<span class="smcap">Friends of Later Years</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> should know little enough of
George Borrow&rsquo;s later years were it not for his friendship
with Thomas Gordon Hake and Theodore Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; Hake was
born in 1809 and died in 1895.&nbsp; In 1839 he settled at Bury
St. Edmunds as a physician, and he resided there until
1853.&nbsp; Here he was frequently visited by the Borrows.&nbsp;
We have already quoted his prophecy concerning <i>Lavengro</i>
that &ldquo;its roots will strike deep into the soil of English
letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1853 Dr. Hake and his family left Bury
for the United States, where they resided for some years.&nbsp;
Returning to England they lived at Roehampton and met Borrow
occasionally in London.&nbsp; During these years Hake was,
according to Mr. W. M. Rossetti, &ldquo;the earthly Providence of
the Rossetti family,&rdquo; but he was not, as his <i>Memoirs</i>
show, equally devoted to Borrow.&nbsp; In 1872, however, he went
to live in Germany and Italy for a considerable period.&nbsp;
Concerning the relationship between Borrow and Hake, Mr.
Watts-Dunton has written:</p>
<blockquote><p>After Hake went to live in Germany, Borrow told me
a good deal about their intimacy, and also about his own early
life: for, reticent as he naturally was, he and I got to be
confidential and intimate.&nbsp; His friendship with Hake began
when Hake was practising as a physician in Norfolk.&nbsp; It
lasted during the greater part of Borrow&rsquo;s later
life.&nbsp; When Borrow was living in London his great delight
was to walk over on Sundays from Hereford Square to Coombe End,
call upon Hake, and take a stroll with him over Richmond
Park.&nbsp; They both had a passion for herons and for
deer.&nbsp; At that time Hake was a very intimate friend of my
own, and having had the good fortune to be introduced by him to
Borrow I used to join the two in their walks.&nbsp; Afterwards,
when Hake went to live in Germany, I used to take those walks
with Borrow alone.&nbsp; Two more interesting men it would be
impossible to meet.&nbsp; The remarkable thing was that there was
between them no sort of intellectual sympathy.&nbsp; In style, in
education, in experience, whatever Hake was, Borrow was
not.&nbsp; Borrow knew almost nothing of Hake&rsquo;s writings,
either in prose <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>or in verse.&nbsp; His ideal poet was Pope, and when he
read, or rather looked into, Hake&rsquo;s <i>World&rsquo;s
Epitaph</i>, he thought he did Hake the greatest honour by
saying, &ldquo;there are lines here and there that are nigh as
good as Pope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hake&rsquo;s acquaintance with
Borrow&rsquo;s works was far behind that of some Borrovians who
did not know Lavengro in the flesh, such as Saintsbury and Mr.
Birrell.&nbsp; Borrow was shy, angular, eccentric, rustic in
accent and in locution, but with a charm for me, at least, that
was irresistible.&nbsp; Hake was polished, easy and urbane in
everything, and, although not without prejudice and bias, ready
to shine generally in any society.</p>
<p>So far as Hake was concerned the sole link between them was
that of reminiscence of earlier days and adventures in
Borrow&rsquo;s beloved East Anglia.&nbsp; Among many proofs I
would adduce of this I will give one.&nbsp; I am the possessor of
the MS. of Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Gypsies of Spain</i>, written partly
in a Spanish notebook as he moved about Spain in his colporteur
days.&nbsp; It was my wish that Hake would leave behind him some
memorial of Borrow more worthy of himself and his friend than
those brief reminiscences contained in <i>Memoirs of Eighty
Years</i>.&nbsp; I took to Hake this precious relic of <i>one of
the most wonderful men of the nineteenth century</i>, in order to
discuss with him differences between the MS. and the printed
text.&nbsp; Hake was writing in his invalid chair,&mdash;writing
verses.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does it all matter?&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not think you understand Lavengro,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; Hake replied, &ldquo;And yet Lavengro had an
advantage over me, for <i>he</i> understood <i>nobody</i>.&nbsp;
Every individuality with which he was brought into contact had,
as no one knows better than you, to be tinged with colours of his
own before he could see it at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; That, of course,
was true enough; and Hake&rsquo;s asperities when speaking of
Borrow in <i>Memoirs of Eighty Years</i>,&mdash;asperities which
have vexed a good many Borrovians,&mdash;simply arose from the
fact that it was impossible for two such men to understand each
other.&nbsp; When I told him of Mr. Lang&rsquo;s angry onslaught
upon Borrow in his notes to the <i>Waverley Novels</i>, on
account of his attacks upon Scott, he said, &ldquo;Well, does he
not deserve it?&rdquo;&nbsp; When I told him of Miss
Cobbe&rsquo;s description of Borrow as a <i>poseur</i>, he said
to me, &ldquo;I told you the same scores of times.&nbsp; But I
saw Borrow had bewitched you during that first walk under the
rainbow in Richmond Park.&nbsp; It was that rainbow, I think,
that befooled you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s affection for
Hake, however, was both strong and deep, as I saw after Hake had
gone to Germany and in a way dropped out of Borrow&rsquo;s
ken.&nbsp; Yet Hake was as good a man as ever Borrow was, and for
certain others with whom he was brought in contact as full of a
genuine affection as Borrow was himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton refers here to Hake&rsquo;s asperities when
speaking of Borrow.&nbsp; They are very marked in the <i>Memoirs
of Eighty Years</i>, and nearly all the stories of Borrow&rsquo;s
<a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>eccentricities that have been served up to us by
Borrow&rsquo;s biographers are due to Hake.&nbsp; It is here we
read of his snub to Thackeray.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you read my Snob
Papers in <i>Punch</i>?&rdquo; Thackeray asked him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In <i>Punch</i>?&rdquo; Borrow replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
a periodical I never look at.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was equally rude,
or shall we say Johnsonian, according to Hake, when Miss Agnes
Strickland asked him if she might send him her <i>Queens of
England</i>.&nbsp; He exclaimed, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake
don&rsquo;t, madam; I should not know where to put them or what
to do with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hake is responsible also for that
other story about the woman who, desirous of pleasing him, said,
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Borrow, I have read your books with so much
pleasure!&rdquo;&nbsp; On which he exclaimed, &ldquo;Pray, what
books do you mean, madam?&nbsp; Do you mean my account
books?&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Johnson was guilty of many such vagaries,
and the readers of Boswell have forgiven him everything because
they are conveyed to them through the medium of a
hero-worshipper.&nbsp; Borrow never had a Boswell, and despised
the literary class so much that he never found anything in the
shape of an apologist until he had been long dead.</p>
<p>I find no letter from Hake to Borrow among my papers, but
three to his wife:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Bury

and as respects the subject of your note you may make yourself
quite easy, for I believe the idea has crossed no other mind than
your own.&nbsp; How sorry I am to learn that you have been so
unwell since your visit to us.&nbsp; I hope that by care you will
get strong during this bracing weather.&nbsp; I wish that you
were already nearer to us, and cannot resign the hope that we
shall yet enjoy the happiness of having you as our
neighbours.&nbsp; I have felt a strong friendship for Mr.
Borrow&rsquo;s mind for many years, and have ardently wished from
time to time to know him, and to have realised my desire I
consider one of the most happy events of my life.&nbsp; Until
lately, dear Mrs. Borrow, I have had no opportunity of knowing
you and your sweet simple-hearted child; but now I hope nothing
will occur to interrupt a regard and friendship which I and Mrs.
Hake feel most truly towards you all.&nbsp; Tell Mr. Borrow how
much we should like to be his Sinbad.&nbsp; I wish he would bring
you all and his papers and come again to look about him.&nbsp;
There is an old hall at Tostock, which, I hear to-day, is quite
dry; if so it is worthy of your attention.&nbsp; It is a mile
from the Elmswell station, which is ten minutes&rsquo; time from
Bury.&nbsp; This <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

but some friends of mine have been over it and they tell me there
is not a damp spot on the premises.&nbsp; It is seven miles from
Bury.&nbsp; Mrs. Hake has written about a house at Rougham, but
had no answer.&nbsp; The cottage at Farnham is to let
again.&nbsp; I know not whether Mr. Harvey will make an effort
for it.&nbsp; A little change would do you all good, and we can

255</span>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />
<span class="smcap">Henrietta Clarke</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Borrow</span> never had a child, but happy
for him was the part played by his stepdaughter Henrietta in his
life.&nbsp; She was twenty-three years old when her mother
married him, and it is clear to me that she was from the
beginning of their friendship and even to the end of his life
devoted to her stepfather.&nbsp; Readers of <i>Wild Wales</i>
will recall not only the tribute that Borrow pays to her, which
we have already quoted, in which he refers to her &ldquo;good
qualities and many accomplishments,&rdquo; but the other pleasant
references in that book.&nbsp; &ldquo;Henrietta,&rdquo; he says
in one passage, &ldquo;played on the guitar <a
name="citation255"></a><a href="#footnote255"
class="citation">[255]</a> and sang a Spanish song, to the great
delight of John Jones.&rdquo;&nbsp; When climbing Snowdon he is
keen in his praises of the endurance of &ldquo;the gallant
girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; As against all this, there is an undercurrent
of depreciation of his stepdaughter among Borrow&rsquo;s
biographers.&nbsp; The picture of Borrow&rsquo;s home in later
life at Oulton is presented by them with sordid details.&nbsp;
The Oulton tradition which still survives among the few
inhabitants who lived near the Broad at Borrow&rsquo;s death in
1881, and still reside there, is of an ill-kept home, supremely
untidy, and it is as a final indictment of his daughter&rsquo;s
callousness that we have the following gruesome picture by Dr.
Knapp:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the 26th of July 1881 Mr. Borrow was found dead
in his house at Oulton.&nbsp; The circumstances were these.&nbsp;
His stepdaughter and her husband drove to Lowestoft in the
morning on some business of their own, leaving Mr. Borrow without
a living soul in the house with him.&nbsp; He had earnestly
requested them not to go away because he felt that he was in a
dying state; but the response intimated that he had often
expressed the same feeling before, and his fears had proved
groundless.&nbsp; During the interval of these few hours of
abandonment nothing can palliate or excuse, George Borrow died as
he had lived&mdash;<i>alone</i>!&nbsp; His age was seventy-eight
years and twenty-one days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>Dr.
Knapp no doubt believed all this; <a name="citation256"></a><a
href="#footnote256" class="citation">[256]</a> it is endorsed by
the village gossip of the past thirty years, and the mythical
tragedy is even heightened by a further story of a farm tumbril
which carried poor Borrow&rsquo;s body to the railway station
when it was being conveyed to London to be buried beside his wife
in Brompton Cemetery.</p>
<p>The tumbril story&mdash;whether correct or otherwise&mdash;is
a matter of indifference to me.&nbsp; The legend of the neglect
of Borrow in his last moments is, however, of importance, and the
charge can easily be disproved.&nbsp; I have before me Mrs.
MacOubrey&rsquo;s diary for 1881.&nbsp; I have many such diaries
for a long period of years, but this for 1881 is of particular
moment.&nbsp; Here, under the date July 26th, we find the brief
note, <i>George Borrow died at three o&rsquo;clock this
morning</i>.&nbsp; It is scarcely possible that Borrow&rsquo;s
stepdaughter and her husband could have left him alone at three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning in order to drive into Lowestoft,
less than two miles distant.&nbsp; At this time, be it
remembered, Dr. MacOubrey was eighty-one years of age.&nbsp; Now,
as to the general untidiness of Borrow&rsquo;s home at the time
of his death&mdash;the point is a distasteful one, but it had
better be faced.&nbsp; Henrietta was nineteen years of age when
her mother married Borrow.&nbsp; She was sixty-four at the time
of his death, and her husband, as I have said, was eighty-one
years of age at that time, being three years older than
Borrow.&nbsp; Here we have three very elderly people keeping
house together and little accustomed overmuch to the assistance
of domestic servants.&nbsp; The situation at once becomes
clear.&nbsp; Mrs. Borrow had a genius for housekeeping and for
management.&nbsp; She watched over her husband, kept his
accounts, held the family purse, managed all his affairs.&nbsp;
She &ldquo;managed&rdquo; her daughter also, delighting in that
daughter&rsquo;s accomplishments of drawing and botany, to which
may be added a zeal for the writing of stories which does not
seem, judging from the many manuscripts in her handwriting that I
have burnt, to have received much editorial encouragement.&nbsp;
In short, Henrietta was not domesticated.&nbsp; But just as I
have proved in preceding chapters that Borrow was happy in his
married life, so I would urge that as far as a somewhat
disappointed career <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>would permit to the sadly bereaved
author he was happy in his family circle to the end.&nbsp; It was
at his initiative that, when he had returned to Oulton after the
death of his wife, his daughter and her husband came to live with
him.&nbsp; He declared that to live alone was no longer
tolerable, and they gave up their own home in London to join him
at Oulton.</p>
<p>A new glimpse of Borrow on his domestic side has been offered
to the public even as this book is passing through the
press.&nbsp; Mr. S. H. Baldrey, a Norwich solicitor, has given
his reminiscences of the author of <i>Lavengro</i> to the leading
newspaper of that city.&nbsp; Mr. Baldrey is the stepson of the
late John Pilgrim of the firm of Jay and Pilgrim, who were
Borrow&rsquo;s solicitors at Norwich in the later years of his
life.&nbsp; One at least of Mr. Baldrey&rsquo;s many
reminiscences has in it an element of romance; that in which he
recalls Mrs. Borrow and her daughter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mrs. Borrow always struck me as a dear old
creature.&nbsp; When Borrow married her she was a widow with one
daughter, Henrietta Clarke.&nbsp; The old lady used to dress in
black silk.&nbsp; She had little silver-grey corkscrew curls down
the side of her face; and she wore a lace cap with a mauve ribbon
on top, quite in the Early Victorian style.&nbsp; I remember that
on one occasion when she and Miss Clarke had come to Brunswick
House they were talking with my mother in the temporary absence
of George Borrow, who, so far as I can recall, had gone into
another room to discuss business with John Pilgrim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;George is a good man, but
he is a strange creature.&nbsp; Do you know he will say to me
after breakfast, &lsquo;Mary, I am going for a walk,&rsquo; and
then I do not see anything more of him for three months.&nbsp;
And all the time he will be walking miles and miles.&nbsp; Once
he went right into Scotland, and never once slept in a
house.&nbsp; He took not even a handbag with him or a clean
shirt, but lived just like any old tramp.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Baldrey is clearly in error here, or shall we say that
Mrs. Borrow humorously exaggerated?&nbsp; We have seen that
Borrow&rsquo;s annual holiday was a matter of careful
arrangement, and his knapsack or satchel is frequently referred
to in his descriptions of his various tours.&nbsp; But the matter
is of little importance, and Mr. Baldrey&rsquo;s pictures of
Borrow are excellent, including that of his personal
appearance:</p>
<blockquote><p>As I recall him, he was a fine, powerfully built
man of about six feet high.&nbsp; He had a clean-shaven face with
a fresh complexion, almost approaching to the florid, and never a
wrinkle, <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>even at sixty, except at the corners of his dark and
rather prominent eyes.&nbsp; He had a shock of silvery white
hair.&nbsp; He always wore a very badly brushed silk hat, a black
frock coat and trousers, the coat all buttoned down before; low
shoes and white socks, with a couple of inches of white showing
between the shoes and the trousers.&nbsp; He was a tireless
walker, with extraordinary powers of endurance, and was also very
handy with his fists, as in those days a gentleman required to
be, more than he does now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. John Pilgrim lived at Brunswick House, on the Newmarket
Road, Norwich, and here Borrow frequently visited him.&nbsp; Mr.
Baldrey recalls one particular visit:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a curious recollection of his dining one
night at Brunswick House.&nbsp; John Pilgrim, who was a careful,
abstemious man, never took more than two glasses of port at
dinner.&nbsp; &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said Borrow, &ldquo;this is a
good port.&nbsp; I prefer Burgundy if you can get it good; but,
lord, you cannot get it now.&rdquo;&nbsp; It so happened that Mr.
Pilgrim had some fine old Clos-Vougeot in the cellar.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I can give you a good drop
of Burgundy.&rdquo;&nbsp; A bottle was sent for, and Borrow
finished it, alone and unaided.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
remarked, &ldquo;I think this is a good Burgundy.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m not quite certain.&nbsp; I should like to try a little
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another bottle was called up, and the guest
finished it to the last drop.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am still,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;not quite sure about it, but I shall know in the
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next morning Mr. Pilgrim and I were
leaving for the office, when Borrow came up the garden path
waving his arms like a windmill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, John,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that <i>was</i> Burgundy!&nbsp; When I woke up this
morning it was coursing through my veins like fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet Borrow was not a man to drink to excess.&nbsp; I cannot
imagine him being the worse for liquor.&nbsp; He had wonderful
health and digestion.&nbsp; Neither a gourmand nor a gourmet, he
could take down anything, and be none the worse for it.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think you could have made him drunk if you tried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is a glimpse of Borrow after his wife&rsquo;s death,
for which we are grateful to Mr. Baldrey:</p>
<blockquote><p>After the funeral of Mrs. Borrow he came to
Norwich and took me over to Oulton with him.&nbsp; He was silent
all the way.&nbsp; When we got to the little white wicket gate
before the approach to the house he took off his hat and began to
beat his breast like an Oriental.&nbsp; He cried aloud all the
way up the path.&nbsp; He calmed himself, however, by the time
that Mr. Crabbe had opened the door and asked us in.&nbsp; Crabbe
brought in some wine, and we all sat down to table.&nbsp; I sat
opposite to Mrs. Crabbe; her husband was on my left hand.&nbsp;
Borrow sat at one end of the table, and the chair at the opposite
end was left vacant.&nbsp; We were talking <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>in a casual
way when Borrow, pointing to the empty chair, said with profound
emotion, &ldquo;There!&nbsp; It was there that I first saw
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a curious coincidence that though there
were four of us we should have left that particular seat
unoccupied at a little table of about four feet square.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is a lengthy digression from the story of Henrietta
Clarke, who married William MacOubrey, an Irishman&mdash;and an
Orangeman&mdash;from Belfast in 1865.&nbsp; The pair lived first
in Belfast and afterwards at 80 Charlotte Street, Fitzroy
Square.&nbsp; Before his marriage he had practised at 134 Sloane
Street, London.&nbsp; MacOubrey, although there had been some
doubt cast upon the statement, was a Doctor of Medicine of
Trinity College, Dublin, and a Barrister-at-Law.&nbsp; Within his
limitations he was an accomplished man, and before me lie not
only documentary evidence of his M.D. and his legal status, but
several printed pamphlets that bear his name.&nbsp; What is of
more importance, the many letters from and to his wife that have
passed through my hands and have been consigned to the flames
prove that husband and wife lived on most affectionate terms.</p>
<p>It is natural that Borrow&rsquo;s correspondence with his
stepdaughter should have been of a somewhat private character,
and I therefore publish only a selection from his letters to her,
believing however that they will modify an existing tradition
very considerably:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. MacOubrey</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;Have you
heard from the gentleman whom you said you would write to about
the farm?&nbsp; Mr. C. came over the other day and I mentioned
the matter to him, but he told me that he was on the eve of going
to London on law business and should be absent for some
time.&nbsp; His son is in Cambridge.&nbsp; I am afraid that it
will be no easy matter to find a desirable tenant and that none
are likely to apply but a set of needy speculators; indeed, there
is a general dearth of money.&nbsp; How is Dr. M.?&nbsp; God
bless you!</p>

Smith has paid his Michaelmas rent I will settle your interest up

you, as you received five pounds on the account of the present
year.&nbsp; If, however, you are in want of money let me know
forthwith, and I will send you a small cheque.&nbsp; The document
which I mentioned has been witnessed by Mrs. Church and her
daughter.&nbsp; It is in one of the little tin boxes on the lower
shelf of the closet nearest to the window in my bedroom.&nbsp; I
was over at Mattishall some weeks ago.&nbsp; Things there look
very unsatisfactory.&nbsp; H. and his mother now owe me &pound;20
or more.&nbsp; The other man a year&rsquo;s rent for a cottage
and garden, and two years&rsquo; rent for the gardens of two
cottages unoccupied.&nbsp; I am just returned from Norwich where
I have been to speak to F.&nbsp; I have been again pestered by
Pilgrim&rsquo;s successor about the insurance of the
property.&nbsp; He pretends to have insured again.&nbsp; A more
impudent thing was probably never heard of.&nbsp; He is no agent
of mine, and I will have no communication with him.&nbsp; I have
insured myself in the Union Office, and have lately received my
second policy.&nbsp; I have now paid upwards of twelve pounds for
policies.&nbsp; F. says that he told him months ago that the
demand he made would not be allowed, that I insured myself and
was my own agent, and that as he shall see him in a few days he
will tell him so again.&nbsp; Oh what a source of trouble that
wretched fellow Pilgrim has been both to you and me.</p>
<p>I wish very much to come up to London.&nbsp; But I cannot
leave the country under present circumstances.&nbsp; There is not
a person in these parts in whom I can place the slightest
confidence.&nbsp; I must inform you that at our interview F. said
not a word about the matter in Chancery.&nbsp; God bless
you.&nbsp; Kind remembrances to Dr. M.</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. MacOubrey</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I wish to
know how you are.&nbsp; I shall shortly send a cheque for
thirteen pounds, which I believe will settle the interest account
up to Michaelmas.&nbsp; If you see anything inaccurate pray
inform me.&nbsp; I am at present tolerably well, but of late have
been very much troubled with respect to my people.&nbsp; Since I
saw you I have been three times over to Mattishall, but with very
little profit.&nbsp; The last time I was there I got the key of
the house from that fellow Hill, and let the place to another
person who I am told is not much better.&nbsp; One comfort is
that he cannot be worse.&nbsp; But now there is a
difficulty.&nbsp; Hill <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>refuses to yield up the land, and
has put padlocks on the gates.&nbsp; These I suppose can be
removed as he is not in possession of the key of the house.&nbsp;
On this point, however, I wish to be certain.&nbsp; As for the
house, he and his mother, who is in a kind of partnership with
him, have abandoned it for two years, the consequence being that
the windows are dashed out, and the place little better than a
ruin.&nbsp; During the four years he has occupied the land he has
been cropping it, and the crops have invariably been sold before
being reaped, and as soon as reaped carried off.&nbsp; During the
last two years there has not been a single live thing kept on the
premises, not so much as a hen.&nbsp; He now says that there are
some things in the house belonging to him.&nbsp; Anything,
however, which he has left is of course mine, though I
don&rsquo;t believe that what he has left is worth
sixpence.&nbsp; I have told the incoming tenant to deliver up
nothing, and not permit him to enter the house on any
account.&nbsp; He owes me ten or twelve pounds, arrears of rent,
and at least fifteen for dilapidations.&nbsp; I think the fellow
ought to be threatened with an action, but I know not whom to
employ.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to apply to F.&nbsp; Perhaps Dr.
M.&rsquo;s London friend might be spoken to.&nbsp; I believe
Hill&rsquo;s address is Alfred Hill, Mattishall, Norfolk, but the
place which he occupied of me is at Mattishall Burgh.&nbsp; I
shall be glad to hear from you as soon as is convenient.&nbsp; I
have anything but reason to be satisfied with the conduct of
S.&nbsp; He is cropping the ground most unmercifully, and is
sending sacks of game off the premises every week.&nbsp; Surely
he must be mad, as he knows I can turn him out next
Michaelmas.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; Kind regards to Dr.
M.&nbsp; Take care of this.</p>

matter, if not hurried, would turn out tolerably satisfactory,

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I shall be
glad to see you and Dr. M. as soon as you can make it
convenient.&nbsp; In a day or two the house will be in good
repair and very comfortable.&nbsp; I want you to go to the bank
and have the cheque placed to my account.&nbsp; Lady Day is nigh
at hand, and it must be seen after.&nbsp; Buy for me a pair of
those hollow ground razors and tell Dr. M. to bring a little
laudanum.&nbsp; Come if you can on the first of March.&nbsp; It
is dear Mama&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp; God bless you!&nbsp; Kind
regards to Dr. M.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Borrow died, as we have seen, in 1881, and was buried by the
side of his wife in Brompton Cemetery.&nbsp; By his will dated
1st December, 1880, he bequeathed all his property to his
stepdaughter, making his friend, Elizabeth Harvey, her
co-executrix.&nbsp; The will, a copy of which is before me, has
no public interest, but it may be noted that Miss Harvey refused
to act, as the following letter to Mrs. MacOubrey testifies:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. MacOubrey</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Bury St.
Edmunds</span>, <i>August</i> 13<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I was
just preparing to write to you when yours arrived together with
Mrs. Reeve&rsquo;s despatch.&nbsp; You know how earnestly I
desire your welfare&mdash;but <i>because</i> I do so I earnestly
advise you immediately to exercise the right you have of
appointing another trustee in my place.&nbsp; I am sure <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>it will be
best for you.&nbsp; You ought to have a trustee at least
<i>not</i> older than yourself, and one who has health and
strength for discharging the office.&nbsp; I <i>know</i> what are
the duties of a trustee.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s <i>always</i> a
considerable responsibility involved in the discharge of the
duties of a trustee&mdash;and it may easily occur that great
responsibility may be thrown on them, and it may become an
anxious business fit only for those who have youth and health and
strength of mind, and are likely to live.</p>
<p>My dear friend, you do not like to realise the old age of your
dear friends, but you must consider that I am quite past the age
for such an office, and my invalid state often prevents my
attending to my own small affairs.&nbsp; I have no relation or
confidential friend who can act for me.&nbsp; My executors were
Miss Venn and John Venn.&nbsp; Miss Venn departed last February
to a better land.&nbsp; John is in such health with heart disease
that he cannot move far from his home&mdash;he writes as one
<i>ready</i> and desiring to depart.&nbsp; I do not expect to see
<i>him</i> again.&nbsp; So you see, my dearest friend, I am not
able to undertake this trusteeship, and I think the sooner you
consult Mrs. Reeve as to the appointment of another
trustee&mdash;the better it will be&mdash;and the more
<i>permanent</i>.&nbsp; Had I known it was Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s
intention to put down my name I should have prevented it, and he
would have seen that an aged and invalid lady was not the person
to carry out his wishes&mdash;for I am quite unable.</p>
<p>I pray that a fit person may be induced to undertake the
business, and that it may please God so to order all for your
good.&nbsp; It is indeed the greatest mercy that your dear
husband is well enough to afford you such help and such
comfort.&nbsp; Pray hire a proper servant who will obey
orders.&mdash;In haste, ever yrs. affectionately,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">E.
Harvey</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another letter that has some bearing upon Borrow&rsquo;s last
days is worth printing here:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
Mrs. MacOubrey</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Yarmouth</span>,
<i>August</i> 19, 1881.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. MacOubrey</span>,&mdash;I was
very sorry indeed to hear of Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I
thought he looked older the last time I saw him, but with his
vigorous constitution I have not thought the end so near.&nbsp;
You and Mr. MacOubrey have the comfort of knowing that you have
attended affectionately to his declining years, which would
otherwise have been very lonely.&nbsp; I have been abroad for a
short time, and this has prevented me from replying to your kind
letter before.&nbsp; Pray receive the assurance of my sympathy,
and with my kind remembrances to Mr. MacOubrey, believe me, yours
very truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">R. H. Inglis

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>Three
years later Dr. MacOubrey died in his eighty-fourth year, and was
interred at Oulton.&nbsp; Mrs. MacOubrey lived for a time at
Oulton and then removed to Yarmouth.&nbsp; A letter that she
wrote to a friend soon after the death of her husband is perhaps
some index to her character:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Oulton Cottage</span>, <span
class="smcap">Oulton</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Nr.
Lowestoft</span>, <i>Sept.</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1884.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg to thank
you for your kind thought of me.&nbsp; On Sunday night the 24th
Augst., it pleased God to take from me my excellent and beloved
husband&mdash;his age was nearly 84.&nbsp; He sunk simply from
age and weakness.&nbsp; I was his nurse by night and by day,
administering constant nourishment, but he became weaker and
weaker, till at last &ldquo;The silver cord was
loosed.&rdquo;&nbsp; My dear father died about this time three
years since, which makes the blow more stunning.&nbsp; I feel
very lonely now in my secluded residence on the banks of the
Broad&mdash;the music of the wild birds adds not to my pleasure
now.&nbsp; Trusting that yourself and Mrs. S&mdash; may long be
spared.&mdash;Believe me to remain, yours very truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Henrietta
MacOubrey</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cottage at Oulton was soon afterwards pulled down, but the
summer-house where Borrow wrote a portion of his <i>Bible in
Spain</i> and his other works remained for some years.&nbsp; That
ultimately an entirely new structure took its place may be seen
by comparing the roof in Mrs. MacOubrey&rsquo;s drawing with the
illustration of the structure as it is to-day.&nbsp; Mrs.
MacOubrey died in 1903 at Yarmouth, and the following inscription
may be found on her tomb in Oulton Churchyard:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sacred to the memory of Henrietta Mary, widow of
William MacOubrey, only daughter of Lieut. Henry Clarke, <span
class="smcap">R.N.</span>, and Mary Skepper, his wife, and
stepdaughter of George Henry Borrow, Esq., the celebrated author
of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, <i>The Gypsies of Spain</i>,
<i>Lavengro</i>, <i>The Romany Rye</i>, <i>Wild Wales</i>, and
other works and translations.&nbsp; Henrietta Mary MacOubrey was
born at Oulton Hall in this Parish, May 17th, 1818, and died 23rd
December 1903.&nbsp; &ldquo;And He shall give His angels charge
over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.&rdquo;&mdash;Psalm xci.
11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extract from her will is of interest as
indicating the trend of a singularly kindly nature.&nbsp; The
intimate friends of Mrs. MacOubrey&rsquo;s later years, whose
opinion is <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>of more value than that of village gossips, speak of
her in terms of sincere affection:</p>
<blockquote><p>I give the following charitable legacies, namely,
to the London Bible Society, in remembrance of the great interest
my dear father, George Henry Borrow, took in the success of its
great work for the benefit of mankind, the sum of one hundred
pounds.&nbsp; To the Foreign Missionary Society the sum of one
hundred pounds.&nbsp; To the London Religious Tract Society the
sum of one hundred pounds.&nbsp; To the London Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the sum of one hundred
pounds.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Aftermath</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are all Borrovians
now.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustine
Birrell</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a curious fact that of only
two men of distinction in English letters in these later years
can it be said that they lived to a good old age and yet failed
of recognition for work that is imperishable.&nbsp; Many poets
have died young&mdash;Shelley and Keats for example&mdash;to whom
this public recognition was refused in their lifetime.&nbsp; But
given the happiness of reaching middle age, this recognition has
never failed.&nbsp; It came, for example, to Wordsworth and
Coleridge long after their best work was done.&nbsp; It came with
more promptness to all the great Victorian novelists.&nbsp; This
recognition did not come in their lifetime to two Suffolk
friends, Edward FitzGerald with <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i> and
George Borrow with <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; In the case of
FitzGerald there was probably no consciousness that he had
produced a great poem.&nbsp; In any case his sunny Irish
temperament could easily have surmounted disappointment if he had
expected anything from the world in the way of literary
fame.&nbsp; Borrow was quite differently made.&nbsp; He was as
intense an egoist as Rousseau, whose work he had probably never
read, and would not have appreciated if he had read.&nbsp; He
longed for the recognition of the multitude through his books,
and thoroughly enjoyed it when it was given to him for a
moment&mdash;for his <i>Bible in Spain</i>.&nbsp; Such
appreciation as he received in his lifetime was given to him for
that book and for no other.&nbsp; There were here and there
enthusiasts for his <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp;
Dr. Jessopp has told us that he was one.&nbsp; But it was not
until long after his death that the word &ldquo;Borrovian&rdquo;
<a name="citation268"></a><a href="#footnote268"
class="citation">[268]</a> came into the language.&nbsp; Not a
single great author among his contemporaries praised him for his
<i>Lavengro</i>, the book for which we most esteem him
to-day.&nbsp; His name is not <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>mentioned by Carlyle or Tennyson or
Ruskin in all their voluminous works.&nbsp; Among the novelists
also he is of no account.&nbsp; Dickens and Thackeray and George
Eliot knew him not.&nbsp; Charlotte Bront&euml; does indeed write
of him with enthusiasm, <a name="citation269a"></a><a
href="#footnote269a" class="citation">[269a]</a> but she is alone
among the great Victorian authors in this particular.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Lavengro</i> received no commendation from
contemporary writers of the first rank.&nbsp; He died in his
seventy-eighth year an obscure recluse whose works were all but
forgotten.&nbsp; Since that year, 1881, his fame has been
continually growing.&nbsp; His greatest work, <i>Lavengro</i>,
has been reprinted with introductions by many able critics; <a
name="citation269b"></a><a href="#footnote269b"
class="citation">[269b]</a> notable essayists have proclaimed his
worth.&nbsp; Of these Mr. Watts-Dunton and Mr. Augustine Birrell
have been the most assiduous.&nbsp; The efforts of the former
have already been noted.&nbsp; Mr. Birrell has expressed his
devotion in more than one essay. <a name="citation269c"></a><a
href="#footnote269c" class="citation">[269c]</a>&nbsp; Referring
to a casual reference <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>by Robert Louis Stevenson to <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, <a name="citation270a"></a><a
href="#footnote270a" class="citation">[270a]</a> in which R. L.
S. speaks well of that book, Mr. Birrell, not without irony,
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is interesting to know this, interesting, that
is, to the great Clan Stevenson, who owe suit and service to
their liege lord; but so far as Borrow is concerned, it does not
matter, to speak frankly, two straws.&nbsp; The author of
<i>Lavengro</i>, <i>The Romany Rye</i>, <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, and <i>Wild Wales</i> is one of those kings of
literature who never need to number their tribe.&nbsp; His
personality will always secure him an attendant company, who,
when he pipes, must dance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is to sum up the situation to perfection.&nbsp; You
cannot force people to become readers of Borrow by argument, by
criticism, or by the force of authority.&nbsp; You reach the
stage of admiration and even love by effects which rise remote
from all questions of style or taste.&nbsp; To say, as does a
recent critic, that &ldquo;there is something in Borrow after
all; not so much as most people suppose, but still a great
deal,&rdquo; <a name="citation270b"></a><a href="#footnote270b"
class="citation">[270b]</a> is to miss the compelling power of
his best books as they strike those with whom they are among the
finest things in literature.&nbsp; In attempting to interest new
readers in the man&mdash;and this book is not for the sect called
Borrovians, to whom I recommend the earlier biographies, but for
a wider public which knows not Borrow&mdash;I hope I shall
succeed in sending many to those incomparable works, which have
given me so many pleasant hours.</p>

impossible to think that he would call his wife a
&lsquo;cart.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps he intended
&lsquo;Carreta&rsquo; for &lsquo;Querida.&rsquo;&nbsp; Probably
their pronunciation was not Castillian, and they spelled the word
as they pronounced it.&nbsp; In speaking of her to
&lsquo;Hen.&rsquo; Borrow always called her
&lsquo;Mamma.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. MacOubrey took a great fancy to
me because she said I was like &lsquo;Mamma.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
meant in character, not in person.&rdquo;</p>

Johnson&rsquo;s essay on Borrow is the more valuable in its
enthusiasm in that it was written by a Roman Catholic.&nbsp;
Writing in the <i>Outlook</i> (1st April, 1899) he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What the four books mean and are to their
lovers is upon this sort.&nbsp; Written by a man of intense
personality, irresistible in his hold upon your attention, they
take you far afield from weary cares and business into the
enamouring airs of the open world, and into days when the
countryside was uncontaminated by the vulgar conventions which
form the worst side of &lsquo;civilised&rsquo; life in
cities.&nbsp; They give you the sense of emancipation, of
manumission into the liberty of the winding road and fragrant
forest, into the freshness of an ancient country-life, into a
<i>milieu</i> where men are not copies of each other.&nbsp; And
you fall in with strange scenes of adventure, great or small, of
which a strange man is the centre as he is the scribe; and from a
description of a lonely glen you are plunged into a dissertation
upon difficult old tongues, and from dejection into laughter, and
from gypsydom into journalism, and everything is equally
delightful, and nothing that the strange man shows you can come
amiss.&nbsp; And you will hardly make up your mind whether he is
most Don Quixote, or Rousseau, or Luther, or Defoe; but you will
always love these books by a brave man who travelled in far
lands, travelled far in his own land, travelled the way of life
for close upon eighty years, and died in perfect solitude.&nbsp;
And this will be the least you can say, though he would not have
you say it&mdash;<i>Requiescat in pace Viator</i>.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
